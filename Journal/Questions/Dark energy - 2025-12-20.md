## My Question
What even is dark energy and dark matter?

## Reason why it appeared:
Video seen about new potential discoveries soon coming from 2025 and forward with the next generation of telescopes like: "Vera Rubin observatory". Theory right now is that this dark energy is weakening and something about the "small red dot" black holes are interesting which will be investigated and measure with the "LISA" sent up or being sent up soon, I don't know which it was.
