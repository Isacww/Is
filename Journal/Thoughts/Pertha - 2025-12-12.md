## My Connection

Pertha germanic folklore (Perchta) or a rune (Pethra), or a light installation (Pertha the gianta sphere). Perchta is a apin godess/spirit that is related to spinning, MIdvintern, and protector of stock, little lika Holda.
Associated with the 12 daws between christmas and "trettonhelgen", and those who does not finish their chrimstas spinning before christmas sometimes gets punnsihed by Perchta.
## Synchronicities
Right as i was waking up. I was dreaming about nordic ols civilizations practizing traditional cermoneries of some kind. And then something about Perthas monolith or Spear popped up out of litterely nowhere right is i was waking up.

## Cross-References
I recently feel like the nordic climate maybe not as bad as i have beeen felling it to be the last few years. the cold is no longer seeming the worst anymore.
