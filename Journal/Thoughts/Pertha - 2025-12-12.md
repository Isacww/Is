## My Connection

Pertha germanic folklore (Perchta) or a rune (Pethra), or a light installation (Pertha the gianta sphere). Perchta is a alpine Godess/spirit that is related to spinning, Midvintern, and protector of stock, little like Holda.
Associated with the 12 daws between Christmas and "Trettonhelgen", and those who does not finish their Christmas spinning before Christmas sometimes gets punished by Perchta.
## Synchronicities
Right as i was waking up. I was dreaming about Nordic old civilizations practizing traditional cermoneries of some kind. And then something about Perthas [[monolith]] or Spear popped up out of litterely nowhere right is I was waking up.
[[waking-up-sleep]] [[sleep]]

## Cross-References
I recently feel like the Nordic [[climate]] maybe not as bad as I have been feeling it to be the last few years. the cold is no longer seeming the worst anymore.
