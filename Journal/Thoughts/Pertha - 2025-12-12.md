## My Connection

Pertha germanic folklore (Perchta) or a rune (Pethra), or a light installation (Pertha the gianta sphere). Perchta is a apin godess/spirit that is related to spinning, MIdvintern, and protector of stock, little lika Holda.

## Synchronicities
Right as i was waking up. I was dreaming about nordic ols civilizations practizing traditional cermoneries of some kind. And then something about Perthas monolith or Spear popped up out of litterly nowhere right is i was waking up.

## Cross-References
I recently feel like the nordic climate maybe not as bad as i have beeen felling it to be the last fe years. the cold is no longer seeming the worst anymore.
