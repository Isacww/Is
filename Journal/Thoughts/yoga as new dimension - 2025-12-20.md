## My Connection
When first learning about the 112 ways of enlightenment from yoga from Sadhguru. There are 4 approaches from enlightenment that can be a mix of all 4 but in different amount of them specific for the individual in question. Young people in general tend to have a dominant "body" yoga present, meanwhile a little bit older tend to shift inte intelligence and feeling yoga prominance as body yoga diminishes with the fading physicality for example.

Yoga can be anything, besides the human mind, it can be physical activity of some kind, it can be the work you are doing it can be reading a book, ANYTHING.

When becoming enlightened you align your physical body and spiritual body in a way that allows seeing the connectivity and interconnectedness of things. This in turn led me to believe that God is everything and everything is God. With sounds polarising, and is something I never expected to believe when entering the world of quantum physics as a hobby reading. 

Now I see how we as human minds have dissected and fragmented basically everything and in turn lost the whole picture in the result. When dissecting you can see what the thing looks like in parts and then create your own understanding about its "function" and "properties"
