## My Connection
After reading book 4 "Co-[[creation]]" of the book series "[[Ringing Cedars]]" I have now a more formulated view on why I have a strong urge to live in my own acre of [[forest]]. To cultivate a spot of love for co-creation and live with Love that is not scared away by our current way of living. This land or "Motherland" as put in the book, will be "living", fence out of living trees close together and thick bushes in between to mark the territory that will be felt, loved and appreciated by the coming generations with its all ever season alternating beauty and fruitful bearing with berries and what not. This is just an example of the view you can have when creating this space of [[love]].

## Next Actions
Further down the line when all books are read by me in the series, and a bigger picture is formed. I will read them again and write down notes and store my thought here.
