the text in book to explain the cards:
## 4 of cups
The Four of Cups displays a young man sitting under a tree on a mountaintop, far from others. He seems to be in contemplation and meditation. In front of him are three cups laying on the grass while another cup is being offered to him by a hand in the air. The man has crossed his hand and legs, and he is looking down at the three cups, unimpressed, such that he cannot see the cup being presented to him by the stretched arm.

The Four of Cups represents our tendency to take for granted the things that we have, making it hard for us to see what treasures the universe presents us with. We tend to have the answers to our troubles right around us, but we tend to focus too much on what we do not have.

Divinatory meaning from the book for the cards:
Weariness, disgust, aversion, imaginary vexations - as if the wine of this world had caused satiety only. Another cup of wine, as if a fairy gift, is now offered him, but he sees no consolation therein. This is also a card of blended pleasure.

## 2 of wands
The Two of Wands card features a man standing on top of what looks like a castle and in his right hand he holds a miniature globe. From the way he is standing, the man is looking down upon the vast terrain, in which an ocean lies on the left-hand side, whilst the land stretches over on the right-hand side. The man is wearing an orange tunic and a red hat, symbolizing his enthusiasm towards life itself and hunger for adventure respectively. The miniature globe in his hand represents potential for possible expansion of his reach to broader life experiences.

Divinatory meaning from the book for the cards:
Between the alternative readings there is no marriage possible, on the one hand, riches, fortune, magnificence. And on the other, physical suffering, disease, chagrin, sadness, mortification. The design gives one suggestion - here is a lord overlooking his dominion and alternately contemplating a globe. It looks like the malady, the mortification, the sadness of alexander amidst the grandeur of this world's wealth.

## 3 of wands
The Three of Wands depicts a man who is standing on the edge of a cliff, looking over the ocean and the mountains. From the cliff edge, he sees everything that is ahead of him. The Wands are planted into the ground and surround the man as he grasps one in his hand. He seems to look forward and reflect on both the commitment that he has for his plans, as well as the method of execution in order to bring them to reality.

Divinatory meaning from the book for the cards:
He symbolizes established strength, enterprise, effort, trade, discovery, commerce: those are its ships, bearing his merchandise, which are sailing across the sea.

## 10 of cups
On the Ten of Cups, there is a couple holding each other while facing a beautiful house and a green garden. Beside them, there are two children playing joyously. The couple is seen holding each other in a loving and romantic embrace, while the children are freely playing. The couple seems to be in a stable relationship, while also blessed with the abundance of a comfortable home and beautiful children. The green land signifies fertility, and the river shows how freely the feelings of the couple are flowing, meaning that their relationship is quite peaceful. Above in the sky, there are ten cups, shaped in an arc, which are meant to symbolize blessings from heaven. The rainbow behind them shows the end of hard times and sorrows, and a new happy life where each and every one of the family will enjoy. The Ten of Cups card depicts ‘having it all’.

Divinatory meaning from the book for the cards:
Contentment, repose of the entire heart - the perfection of that state, if with several picture cards, a person who is taking charge of the Querent's interests. Also the town, village or county inhabited by the Querent.
