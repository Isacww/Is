(Oversimplified)

Astral energy is the power that runs the [[universe]] you can't see, the subtle [[force]] behind [[dream]]s and beyond-physical experiences. The invisible current that fuels dreams, visions, and every experience beyond the physical world—it's said to be the [[energy]] of the astral plane, a [[dimension]] that sits right next to our own, where thought becomes [[form]] and emotion becomes movement, like an overlay of [[reality]]. If your physical body runs on oxygen and food, your astral body runs on this energy, powering your [[awareness]] when you dream, [[meditate]], or have an [[out-of-body]] experience—it's what keeps your [[consciousness]] mobile in non-physical realms. You could call it the battery of the [[soul]], the charge that allows exploration beyond the body. Ancient mystics believe that astral energy connects every living consciousness in a giant glowing [[web]], the astral network that links dreams, memories, and even emotions across space, explaining synchronicities like thinking of someone and they appear in a dream. That's why sometimes you think of someone out of nowhere and then they call you, or why intense emotions, both [[love]] and hatred, seem to travel through distance—it's all [[vibration]] carried by astral energy, bridging [[mind]]s. The idea goes back thousands of years—in Hinduism, it's part of the [[linga sharira]], the subtle energy body that mirrors the physical one, a vehicle for soul travel. In theosophy and hermeticism, it's called the [[astral double]], the layer of the soul that travels when you dream or project, free from physical limits. Even in Cabala, it appears as the [[ruach]], the emotional force that binds [[spirit]] to [[matter]], a bridge between worlds. Astral energy is said to flow through a person's emotional [[frequency]]—when you're peaceful and loving, the energy is bright, clean, and easy to travel through, like [[clear]] skies for flight; but when you're angry, fearful, or obsessed, it becomes dense, pulling your awareness back down into the physical plane, like mud slowing a journey. That's why spiritual teachers always stress purifying your emotions before attempting astral projection because your energy determines where you end up, guiding the quality of your travels.
