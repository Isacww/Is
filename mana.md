(Oversimplified)

"could gain or lose it through their actions, building it like a skill."

Mana is one of those ideas that sounds simple but once you understand it, it completely changes how you see [[power]], [[luck]], and even life itself, a [[spiritual]] [[force]] inherent in all things. The word [[mana]] comes from [[Polynesia]]n and [[Melanesia]]n cultures, and it means something like spiritual power or divine influence, an invisible [[essence]] that gives authority and vitality. But it isn't a God, and it isn't magic in the fantasy sense—it's the force that [[flow]]s through all living and non-living things, from humans to mountains to the sea. To the Polynesians, everything in the [[universe]] had mana, from people and animals to rocks, oceans, and storms, like a universal [[aura]] of potency. But not all mana was equal—some people were born with more of it, chiefs, warriors, healers, and others could gain or lose it through their actions, building it like a skill. If you were brave, honorable, or wise, your mana grew, enhancing your presence and influence; if you acted selfishly or broke sacred [[rule]]s, your mana weakened, diminishing your strength. So, in a way, mana was both spiritual energy and moral credit, a measure of [[alignment]] with the natural [[order]]. It wasn't just about how powerful you were, but how aligned you were with the laws of [[nature]] and [[spirit]], like a karmic battery that charges through right action. When explorers first arrived in the [[Pacific Islands]], they noticed that the idea of mana wasn't tied to one religion—it was everywhere, appearing in [[Hawaiian Huna]], in [[Maori philosophy]], and in many other island traditions, a shared cultural thread. It was how people explained luck, [[authority]], and even [[charisma]]—a person with strong mana could lead naturally, heal others, or cause change just by their presence, commanding respect without force.
