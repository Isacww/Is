Orgone is one of those concepts that sits right between science and the supernatural, a kind of forbidden [[energy]] that was almost [[erased from history]]. It was proposed in the 1930s by an Austrian psychoanalyst named [[Wilhelm Reich]] who believed he had discovered a new [[form]] of life energy that filled the entire [[universe]], like an all-pervading cosmic vitality you can feel but not always see. He called it orgone, [[the root word of organism, orgasm, and organic,]] tying it to life's creative and dynamic [[essence]]. In simple terms, Reich thought orgone was the cosmic [[life force]], the same thing ancient cultures had always called [[Ch'i]], [[prana]], or [[aether]], just dressed in scientific language to make it more modern and testable. Reich claimed this energy could be measured, concentrated, and stored, so he built strange devices called [[orgone accumulators]]—boxes made of alternating layers of metal and organic material that he said could collect the life force from the [[atmosphere]], acting like a [[magnet]] for [[universal energy]]. People would sit inside these boxes for hours soaking in cosmic vitality like a [[spiritual]] tanning bed, reportedly feeling recharged or healed ([[healing]]). And here's the wild part: he didn't just stop there; Reich believed orgone could heal diseases, boost emotions, and even control the [[weather]], so he built cloud busters, machines designed to shoot orgone energy into the sky to break droughts, which according to witnesses sometimes actually worked, like pulling rain from dry air. To Reich, this was proof that all living things from humans to clouds were part of the same [[living field of energy]], a pulsating [[web]] connecting [[biology]] and the cosmos. But of course, mainstream science wasn't having it; the US government declared his work unscientific and fraudulent, they seized his equipment, banned his books, and even burned his research in one of the largest [[scientific censorship]] events in modern history—Reich was later imprisoned, and he died there. But his ideas refused to die with him; today, orgone has become something of an underground legend, with [[new age]] thinkers, energy healers, and even conspiracy circles still using his ideas to explain how energy, thought, and emotion interact, claiming both good and bad energies can affect its [[balance]], like positive vibes drawing in healing or negative ones causing blockages.
