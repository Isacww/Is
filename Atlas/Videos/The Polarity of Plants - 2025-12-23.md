## Notes on "Plant Polarity" Video by Rupert Sheldrake

### Introduction to Plant Polarity
The speaker, Rupert Sheldrake, introduces his interest in plant [[polarity]], which he has studied for over 50 years since childhood. He became fascinated during his undergraduate studies at Cambridge by the ideas of [[Goethe]], a German poet and scientist who was interested in polarities in nature, including those in plants. Polarity in plants is evident between roots and shoots, as shoots grow toward light and against [[gravity]] while roots grow toward darkness and down. There is also polarity within leaves, between top and bottom or left and right, but the primary polarity is root-shoot.

### Regeneration and Intrinsic Polarity
When parts of a plant are cut, they regenerate in a polar manner. For example, a pollarded willow tree shows new shoots emerging higher up the trunk, with none at the base, demonstrating polar behavior. If a willow branch is cut into pieces, each segment regenerates with roots at the basal end (closest to the original roots) and shoots at the apical end. This [[intrinsic]] polarity persists even when detached, similar to magnets: a [[magnet]] broken in half retains polarity in each piece, with the whole's polarity expressed in the parts.

### Embryonic Establishment of Polarity
Polarity is established early in the plant embryo. In a shepherd's purse embryo, the fertilized [[egg]] develops a suspensor leading to the root tip at one end and the shoot tip at the other, with cotyledons (seedling leaves) folded over in the fully grown embryo. This intrinsic polarity affects growth and behavior from the beginning.

### Discovery of Auxin and Its Role
[[Charles Darwin]] discovered a downward influence from shoot tips maintaining polarity, observed in grass seedlings where removing the tip halts growth, but replacing it resumes it. In the early 20th century, this was identified as auxin (a growth hormone, chemically indole acetic acid, derived from tryptophan), produced in shoots and transported polarly downward toward roots. Sheldrake conducted extensive research on auxin for 15 years at Cambridge and elsewhere.

[[Auxin flow]] has effects: removing the apical bud releases side buds from apical dominance, allowing them to grow; auxin stimulates lateral root growth as it moves down; in cuttings, it accumulates at the basal end to stimulate roots, as seen in willow cuttings.

### Independence from Gravity and Age
Polarity is intrinsic, not gravity-dependent. In a weeping willow, branches hang down, but auxin moves upward toward roots, then around the trunk, following cellular polarity rather than gravity.

Early theories suggested polarity related to cell age, with lower cell ends older due to division. Sheldrake tested this by studying monocot leaves (e.g., grass, bamboo, daffodils), where leaves grow from the base, making youngest cells at the base and oldest at the tip—opposite of dicots. Using radioactive auxin (C14-labeled) on stem segments with agar blocks, he measured transport: auxin moves basipetally (toward base) but not acropetally (toward tip). Experiments on various monocot leaves (daffodil, narcissus, etc.) showed strong polar transport toward roots, regardless of reversed age polarity (published in Nature).

In dicots (e.g., beech, oak, tomato), auxin transport persists in secondary thickening tissues (via cambium dividing longitudinally), not transversely. Studies on tobacco stems showed transport toward roots in outer tissues near phloem, decreasing in older pith, confirming it's tied to active growth cells, not division plane (published in Journal of Experimental Botany).

### Inverted Growth and Polarity
In inverted cuttings (e.g., tomato plants grown upside down with roots at apical end), auxin transport retains original polarity (basipetal), despite reversed growth and sap flow, showing polarity is deeply embedded in cells (published in New Phytologist).

### Fern Protonema and Cellular Polarity
In simpler systems, Sheldrake studied the bird's nest fern (Asplenium nidus) protonema (threadlike structure from germinating spores), a single file of cells with rhizoid (rootlike) at base and growing tip. Polarity is evident: cutting the tip causes side branching (apical dominance). Using [[plasmolysis]] (shrinking cells in sugar/salt solutions like mannitol), cells detach from basal walls and remain attached to apical walls, showing differential membrane attachment. Different substances (e.g., mannitol, magnesium sulfate) enhance polar plasmolysis toward apex, while others (e.g., potassium nitrate) are less effective, indicating variable attachment influenced by [[ions]].

### Electrical Polarity
Electrical polarity is underexplored. Germinating spores/[[egg]]s show [[electrical polarity]] between root and shoot parts. Plants exist in Earth's [[electric field]] (negative ground vs. positive atmosphere, ~100V/m [[gradient]]). Trees conduct electricity via sap, becoming negatively charged tips attracting ions. Recent studies on flowers show petal gradients, with positive [[particle]]s adhering to negative tips. Leaves likely have similar gradients, potentially setting up auxin transport polarity. Initial polarity establishment may involve electric gradients, an open question; experiments suggested (e.g., spraying charged particles on leaves) to test this.

The talk concludes that while auxin transport details (including molecular levels, from work with Philip Rubery) are known, initial polarity origins remain unknown, with [[electricity]] possibly key. More on polar auxin transport in future talks.

This is strongly hinting towards what Anastasia is saying in the "Ringing Cedars", implying the huge [[information]] [[flow]] out of tips of trees, especially [[cedar]] trees.
