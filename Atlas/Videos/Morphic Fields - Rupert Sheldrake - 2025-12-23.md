### Morphic Fields and Morphic Resonance Concept

Morphic [[resonance]] is presented as nature's inherent [[memory]], where the whole of nature has a collective memory for form, instinct, and behavior. Laws of nature are likened to [[habit]]s rather than fixed eternal rules. Each species has a collective memory, tuning into similar systems across time and space through vibratory pattern similarity, allowing resonance with past systems and conveying memory. For example, young antelopes tune into the behavior and form of previous antelopes. Humans do the same, and the collective unconscious is explained as collective memory through morphic resonance. Morphogenetic fields are form-shaping fields that are top-down and holistic, like invisible molds or patterns shaping a developing leaf. They are compared to magnetic fields, retaining wholeness when divided. Inheritance of morphogenetic fields isn't genetic; genes code for proteins, but morphic fields provide the shaping pattern. Morphic fields include morphogenetic (for form in organisms), behavioral (for nervous system activity), mental (for mental activity), and social (for flocks, colonies). All are shaped by morphic resonance with inherent memory.

The concept is repeated as an explanation for various phenomena, emphasizing that morphic resonance works on similarity, with no known mechanism but possible links to David Bohm's implicate order or extra dimensions in string/M-theory. Empirical testing is prioritized over theoretical models, as seen in fields like electromagnetism.

### Critique of Genes and Materialism

Genes are criticized as inadequate for explaining form; they provide proteins but not the "architectural plan," like building materials without a blueprint. Self-assembly is assumed but unproven. Epigenetics involves inheriting gene activation patterns from ancestors, but much is attributed to morphic resonance, including inheritance of acquired characteristics. The Human Genome Project disappointed with fewer genes than expected (~20,000, less than half of a rice plant's), predicting only 5-10% of traits like breast cancer or schizophrenia, despite 80-90% heritability, leading to the "missing heritability" problem. Mechanistic materialism is inadequate; a paradigm shift is needed to view nature as alive, organic, and interconnected like an organism, not a machine. _The Science Delusion_ critiques 10 dogmas, such as laws being fixed and matter unconscious. Consciousness is pervasive and primary, with the universe emerging from consciousness.

### Examples and Evidence of Morphic Resonance

Examples include rats learning mazes faster due to resonance; experiments showed improvement across locations (Harvard, Edinburgh, Melbourne), with speed-ups as more rats learned, indicating collective memory. New compounds are hard to crystallize initially but become easier worldwide as more form them, not due to dust but resonance. Wordle puzzles are harder in the morning than evening as more people solve them. Times crossword puzzles get easier after publication. Crystallization eases over time, and melting points of new compounds rise gradually. Slime mold (Physarum polycephalum) in mazes finds optimal paths; repeated experiments might show faster learning via resonance. These examples are repeated to illustrate testable predictions, such as plotting number of learners vs. speed for new individuals, or measuring field strength via effect magnitude.

### Laws of Nature and Evolutionary Universe

Laws of nature are not fixed but evolve as habits; successful patterns are repeated and become fixed. New systems like lab-created compounds or Bose-Einstein condensates show resonance as they are novel. The assumption of eternal laws leads to miracles (universe from nothing) and absurdities (fine-tuning implying God or multiverses). An evolutionary universe with evolving habits is proposed instead. Constants like the speed of light or gravitational constant G vary slightly over time, with G varying ~1% recently.

### Brain, Mind, and Consciousness

The brain is a tuning system, not memory storage; it coordinates perceptions, senses, movements, and speech. Minds stretch like fields beyond brains (e.g., magnetic or gravitational fields). Vision projects images outward, not contained in the brain. Brain tunes via resonance across time, like a TV set to signals. No material memory traces are found in the brain despite searches; memory is via resonance. Consciousness is not confined to the brain; it extends in perception, dreams (with inner light and dream bodies), and psychedelic experiences. The brain is essential but overrated—changes affect consciousness but do not confine it. Mind at large includes cosmic mind in Earth, sun, stars, galaxy, and cosmos (Plato's anima mundi); divine mind is transcendent if pantheist God is cosmic mind. Consciousness is centered in the body when waking but in virtual realms during dreams or psychedelics. Collective mind/memory occurs via morphic resonance; individuals participate in the collective unconscious as expressions of collective memory.

### Electrical and Social Fields

Electrical polarity is underexplored but mentioned in germinating spores/eggs between root and shoot parts. Plants exist in Earth's electric field, with trees conducting electricity and becoming negatively charged at tips. Social fields are for groups like families (inherited patterns visible in systemic constellations), sports teams (coordinate moods), bands/orchestras/choirs (rituals connect to past), and religions. Intuition and telepathy occur within groups via resonance (e.g., dogs sensing owners' return, telephone telepathy). Thoughts and emotions are not solely individual; they share in collective moods via resonance in social groups (e.g., flocks changing direction, panic spreading).

### Paradigm Change and Advice

Mechanistic materialism is inadequate; nature should be viewed as alive and interconnected. Science should investigate spiritual practices (prayer, meditation, pilgrimage, fasting, rituals, nature connection, celebration) for measurable effects (blood pressure, brain waves, well-being, longevity). Militant atheism is harmful. For students/young scientists, learn mainstream science but seek unconventional funding for radical ideas. Educational systems are mechanistic; learn broader ideas via YouTube/online (e.g., Essentia Foundation). Change is slow but possible.
