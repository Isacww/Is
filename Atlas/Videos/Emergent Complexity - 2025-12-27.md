## Notes on "Emergent Complexity" Video by Emergent Garden 

### Introduction to Emergent Complexity
The speaker opens with a Carl Sagan quote: "Nature, it seems, is the popular name for milliards and milliards and milliards of [[particle]]s playing their infinite game of billiards and billiards and billiards." The [[universe]] is described as "very emergent," meaning "full of simple things that come together to make complex things." It's likened to a "Lego universe" where atoms, through a "galactic game of billiards" over billions of years, form stars, snowflakes, planets, people, galaxies, and even hot dogs. Emergence is "surprisingly complex stuff" arising from "relatively simple stuff." The video is a "tour of emergent complexity" that gets "a little technical and philosophical" but aims to be "practical," offering advice on recognizing and encouraging emergent behavior. The speaker, a programmer with experience in creating emergent systems, uses algorithms to illustrate concepts, grounding them in the real world. Emergence is "weird," [[found everywhere]] but hard to define formally or predict with standard science tools, potentially requiring a [["new kind of science,"]] yet it's intuitive: [["You know it when you see it."]]

### Definition and Examples of Emergence
Emergence occurs when "simple things come together to form complex things which have properties or behaviors that the simple things on their own do not have." The [["collective is greater than the sum of its parts."]] Examples are repeated to illustrate: a single [[water]] molecule (H₂O) versus trillions forming [[fractal]] crystals or exhibiting surface tension; ant colonies performing tasks individual ants cannot; [[brain]]s exhibiting [[function]]s beyond individual neurons. The speaker invites viewers to think of more examples, emphasizing emergence's ubiquity. 

### Building Blocks and Rules as Foundations
Emergent systems have two main building blocks: "building blocks" (things that can be combined, arranged, or put together, such as Lego bricks, billiard balls, atoms, ants, or abstract entities like words, numbers, or bits) and "rules" (which define interactions, e.g., repel/[[attract]], connect/overlap, [[gravity]], momentum, friction). Rules "breathe life" into building blocks. Advice is given: "Find [[emergence]]. Look for building blocks that follow [[rules]]." Examples include water molecules following chemistry rules to form snowflakes; ants following behavioral rules to form colonies; words following syntax/semantics to form [[language]]. Building blocks can be any combinable objects or concepts. The focus shifts to bits (binary code): each bit is 0 or 1; combined into bit strings. With n bits, there are 2ⁿ unique strings, leading to [["combinatorial explosion"]]—exponentially more combinations than blocks. This is "an engine of emergent complexity," "literally greater than the sum of its parts." Examples: buying a Lego set includes all possible builds from those blocks; language where most sentences are novel due to combinatorial explosion. Advice: "If you think you've seen it all, you haven't." There are [[unseen combinations]] in words, bits, pixels, etc., some surprising. Most combinations are uninteresting, but some are valuable—worth searching, like new [[recipes]].

Systems can be scaled by adding [[blocks]], kinds of blocks, or [[layers]] (building blocks of building blocks). E.g., atoms form chemicals, cells, organs, organisms—layers of emergence composed like an "onion." Layers blend, not separate.

### Rules and Their Impact on Complexity
Rules define interactions: chess rules, [[physics]] laws, grammar, [[math]], programming languages. They can be strict/deterministic or loose/non-deterministic (e.g., ants' flexible rules). Even simple rules yield [[complexity]]. Example: 1D cellular [[automata]] (bits updating based on neighbors): bit updates based on left/right/neighbor bits (wrap-around edges). Rule example: if neighborhood is specific (e.g., 010), next is 1; else 0. Starting with sparse 1, evolves to a line. Another rule: fractal ([[Sierpinski triangle]]). Another: chaotic ([[chaos pattern]]) "triangle soup" with order. These are "one-dimensional cellular automata" by [[Stephen Wolfram]], related to Conway's [[Game of Life]] (2D, local rules produce gliders, guns; [[Turing complete]], simulatable in itself).

Many such programs show complex behavior from simple local rules. Patterns aren't predictable without running; "Don't assume you know what's going to happen. Experiment. Try it." [[repetition]]/[[iteration]]/[[recursion]] helps: apply rules repeatedly (time as steps in [[simulations]], fractals, [[equations]]). Concepts not strict: in Game of Life, cells/rules blur.

### Wolfram's Classification of Complexity
Wolfram classified 1D automata rules (e.g., rule 30) into four categories based on [[pattern]]s:
1. "Flat and boring": [[homogeneous]], [[unchanging]] (e.g., graphene, pure steel, ice cubes).
2. "Repetitive and predictable": [[repeating patterns]], [[predictable]] (e.g., layered rocks, [[crystal]]s, sound [[wave]]s, planet orbits).
3. "Chaotic and [[random]]": [[noisy]], [[unstructured]], [[unpredictable]] (e.g., room air, cloud vapor).
4. "Complex and organized": mix of [[order]]/randomness, self-organizing, interesting (e.g., ice/bismuth crystals, [[spiral]]ing galaxies, life/[[mind]] patterns, cone [[snail shell]]s resembling rule 30).

Categories applicable to real systems; not universal (e.g., water transitions phases). Phase transitions: sudden complexity at [[tipping points]] (e.g., water boiling at 100°C).

### Emergent Simplicity and Predictability
Complexity ≠ [[information]]/[[entropy]] (max entropy is random, not organized). Organized complexity implies "[[emergent simplicity]]": higher-level thing simpler than parts (e.g., baseball as sphere with mass/[[force]], simpler than atoms yet more complex overall due to [[organization]]). Stable structures (gliders) [[form]] higher building blocks.

Rules/blocks need not be simple; complex rules can yield more complexity. Universe's [[quantum]] rules are complex, birthing everything.

Predicting hard: e.g., rule 30 center cell after steps—$30,000 prize unsolved. Systems "computationally [[irreducible]]": can't shortcut simulation.

Chaos theory: sensitive to initial conditions (butterfly effect: tiny change causes [[divergence]], e.g., one cell flips outcome). Simulations inaccurate for chaotic systems.

Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science": simple programs show irreducibility; universe as algorithm (not simulation), with "pockets of reducibility." Wolfram Physics Project: [[hypergraph]] simulations for universes.

Wolfram controversial: independent, claims without review, but thought-provoking. Appreciate complexity, expect unexpected.

### Making Emergence
Paradoxical but possible: invent rules, discover consequences. "Design by emergence": build blocks/rules, not outcomes (e.g., open-ended games, tools, growing things).

Direct build complex, but for self-organizing: hands-off. Examples: simulations, games with emergent gameplay.

Advice: experiment, trial/error, iterate. Evolutionary approach: vary best, select. Relax control for surprises.

Hard to create intentionally; keep making, surprises come. Sacrifices control: [[unintended consequences]] (control problem). Tweak rules post-emergence (nerf/buff).

Worth it: more out than in (e.g., chess strategies emerged). "You design a little bit and emergence designs the rest."

Conclusion: incorporate into work; be patient, playful. "Grow your own emergent garden." Video born from years of thoughts; encourage sharing.
