## Key Phrase/Quote
Continuity equation: conservation law for a quantity that flows.

Core statement  
The rate of change of a conserved quantity inside a region equals the net flow of that quantity across the region’s boundary, with sources/sinks added if present.

Mass form (fluid mechanics)  
Local form:  
∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρ v) = 0  
ρ = density, v = velocity field.  
Meaning: mass is neither created nor destroyed; density changes only via flow divergence.

Incompressible flow  
ρ constant ⇒ ∇·v = 0  
Meaning: volume is conserved; what flows in must flow out.

Integral form  
d/dt ∫_V ρ dV = − ∮_∂V ρ v·n dA  
Meaning: total mass in a control volume changes only due to flux through its surface.

Generalization  
Applies to any conserved quantity: charge, energy, probability.  
Generic form:  
∂q/∂t + ∇·J = S  
q = density, J = flux, S = source term.

Interpretation  
Pure bookkeeping enforced by conservation.  
Local differential form encodes global conservation.
