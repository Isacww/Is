## Key Phrase/Quote
[[Continuity]] equation: [[conservation law for a quantity that flows]].

Core statement  
The rate of change of a conserved quantity inside a region equals the net flow of that quantity across the region’s boundary, with sources/sinks added if present.

[[mass form]] (fluid mechanics)  
Local form:  
∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρ v) = 0  
ρ = density, v = [[velocity field]].  
Meaning: mass is neither created nor destroyed; density changes only via flow divergence.

[[incompressible flow]]  
ρ constant ⇒ ∇·v = 0  
Meaning: volume is conserved; what flows in must flow out.

[[integral form]]  
d/dt ∫_V ρ dV = − ∮_∂V ρ v·n dA  
Meaning: total mass in a control volume changes only due to flux through its surface.

[[generalization]]  
Applies to any conserved quantity: charge, energy, probability.  
Generic form:  
∂q/∂t + ∇·J = S  
q = density, J = flux, S = source term.

[[interpretation  ]]
Pure bookkeeping enforced by conservation.  
Local differential form encodes global conservation.

In the integral form of the continuity equation, _S_ is any [closed surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_surface "Closed surface") that fully encloses a volume _V_, like any of the surfaces on the left. _S_ can _not_ be a surface with boundaries, like those on the right. (Surfaces are blue, boundaries are red.)

## My Connection
I feel like this is a very important feature for [[light]] and [[matter]]. And [[manifistation]] 

## Synchronicities
Thought of this when reading about talbots holographic worldview and the slit-quantuum experiment. also when reading it in [[Quantum Ontology]] by [[Peter J. Lewis]]
