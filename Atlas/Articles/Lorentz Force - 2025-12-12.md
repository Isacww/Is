## My Connection
I believe Lorentz force could be the ground principle showing the behavior of something more than we understand. We know of fields, like energy, magnetic gravity fields but not WHAT they are. As of my understanding that is, we know some things that happens when interacting with them but not much else.

## Synchronicities
[[Magnetism]] [[Force]] [[unknown origin]] 

## Cross-References
Field lines in skisses remind me of the golden ratio spiral. [[Golden ratio]] 

## Next Actions
