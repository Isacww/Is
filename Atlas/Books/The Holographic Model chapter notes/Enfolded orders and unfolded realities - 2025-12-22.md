## Enfolded orders and unfolded realities
One of Bohm's most startling assertions is that the tangible reality is really a kind of illusion, like a holographic image. Underlying it is a deeper order of existence, a vast and more primary level of reality, that gives birth to all the objects and appearances of our physical world, like the way holographic film does to the hologram. Bohm calls this the "[[implicate]]" (which means "[[enfolded]]") [[order]], and our own level of existence as the "[[explicate]]" ([[unfolded]]]) order. Bohm believes an electron is not one thing, but a totality or ensemble enfolded throughout the **whole** of space. When an instrument detects the presence of a single electron, it is simply because one aspect of the electron has unfolded. When it appears to be moving it is due to a [[continuous]] series of such unfoldment and enfoldments. Particles are no more substantive or permanent than the form a geyser of water takes as it gushes out of a fountain, sustained by a constant [[influx]] from the implicate order. The constant flowing between the two orders explains how particles can shape-shift from one kind to another. It also explains how a quantum can manifest as either a particle or a wave. Both are in its ensemble, what the observer interaction, with it, is determines whats being [[manifested]], Like the way a jeweler manipulates a gem determines which of its facets become visible and which does not. Hologram refers to a still image --> Bohm describes the universe as a "[[holomovement]]."
