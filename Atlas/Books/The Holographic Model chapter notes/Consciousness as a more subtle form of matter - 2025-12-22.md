## Consciousness as a more subtle form of matter
[[Quantum physics]] find many examples of [[interconnectedness]] when studying [[matter]]. [[Bohm]]'s [[holographic]] [[universe]] explain many other puzzles. One is the effect consciousness seems to have on the [[subatomic world]]. [[Bohm]] says its unnecessary to say that consciousness and matter is **interacting**. In a sense the observer **[[is]]** the observed, and also the measurement device, the experimental results, the laboratory. Consciousness is present in various degrees of [[enfoldment]] and [[unfoldment]] in all matter. As Bohm puts it: " The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of [[mind]], and we have something that is mindlike already with the [[electron]]." Also that deciding non-living and living things is meaningless. Just as a [[hologram]] contains the image of the whole, every portion of the universe enfolds the whole. This means that if we knew how to access it we would find a different galaxy in our thumbnail, we could also find Cleopatra meeting Caesar for the first time, for in principle the whole past and implications for the whole future are also enfolded in each small region of space and time. Every cell in our body enfolds the entire cosmos. So does every leaf, every raindrop and every dust mote, which gives new meaning to [[William Blake]]'s poem:

"To see a world in a grain of sand and a Heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour."

Bohm believes the same is true at our own level of existence. Space is not empty. It is **full**, a [[plenum]] as opposed to a [[vacuum]]. And its the ground for the existence of everything, including ourselves. The universe is not separate from this cosmic sea of [[energy]], it is a ripple on its surface, a comparatively small "pattern of excitation" in the midst of an unimaginable vast ocean. "this pattern is relatively autonomous and five rise to approximately recurrent, stable and separable [[projection]]s into a three-dimensional explicable [[order]] of [[manifistation]]."
