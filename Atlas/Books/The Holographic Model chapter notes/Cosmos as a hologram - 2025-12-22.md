## Cosmos as a hologram
An [[electron]] cannot solely be defined as a [[particle]], since it also has [[wave-like]] qualities. This [[phenomena]] of something that somehow embodies both is called "[[quanta]]" and physicists believe that they are the basic stuff from which the entire [[universe]] is made. A common way of thinking is that quanta (which is a multiple if a single [[quantum]]) only "acts" or transforms into particles when observed. But [[Bohm]] thinks differently.
