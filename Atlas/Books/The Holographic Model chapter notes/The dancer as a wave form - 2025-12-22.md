## The dancer as Wave Form
Tests show that our senses are frequency-analyzers. [[Nikolai Bernstein]]'s discovery even showed that our physical movements may be encoded in our [[brain]]s in a [[Language of Fourier Wave Forms]]. With this he could predict the movements of his subjects to an impressive precision. --> Maybe the brain stores information this way?
