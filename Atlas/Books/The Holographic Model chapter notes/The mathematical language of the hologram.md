## The mathematical language of the hologram
[[Fourier]] : Roughly speaking - mathematical way of converting any pattern, no matter how complex, into a [[language]] of simple waves, showed how these [[wave forms]] could be converted back into the original pattern. 
[[Fourier transforms]] : images --> wave forms --> image --> ...
In fact, the special whole in every part of a [[hologram]] is one of the by products that occurs when an image or pattern is translated into the fourier language of wave forms. Each braincell in the visual complex is geard to respond to a different pattern, some braincells fire when the eyes see a horizontal line, others fire when they see a vertical line, and so on. These cells are called feature detectors. After tests, only one conclusion could be drawn: "The brain was using [[Fourier Mathematics]] - the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the [[Fourier Language]] of [[Wave Forms]]"

[[Brain = Hologram]] : Pribram is convinced of this.
