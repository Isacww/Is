## A living sea of Electrons
At first [[Bohm]] also accepted [[Bohr]]'s position, but remained puzzled by the lack of interest Bohr and the rest had towards [[interconnectedness]]. With this, research in [[plasmas]] took place. They are a gas containing a high density of [[electron]]s and positive ions (atoms that have a positive charge). Once in the [[plasma]], electrons stopped behaving like individuals and started behaving as if they were part of a larger and [[interconnected whole]]. Extending this research he studied electrons in [[metals]]. Once again the seemingly haphazard movements of individual electrons managed to produce highly organized overall effects, just like the plasmas, these were no longer situations involving two particles each behaving as if it know what the other was doing, but entire oceans of particles, each behaving as if they know what trillions of others were doing simultaneously. He called it: "[[plasmons]]".
After the conversation about Bohm's interpretation of Bohr's view of quantum domains, with Einstein, it cemented as the conversial belief as the complete description. This did not sit right with Bohm, as its definition could be infinite in its nature. So he continued his exploration, this time not enthusively followed by the rest of scientific communities.
