## Compact memory
[["Thats not all holography can explain."]] It explains how the brain can store so many memories in so little spance. Average human life stores in average 2.8x10^20 bits of information. Which cannot be explained in other means. Holograms possesses fantastic capacity for information storage. By changing the angle at which the two lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it is possible to record many different images on the same surface! Any image thus recorded can be retrieved by illuminating the film with a laser beam at the same angle as when recording that image. This results in: one-inch-square of film can store the dame amount of information as 50 Bibles. So "remembering" is the action of finding the right angle for beam (mind). When the brain has memorized a face, object or scene and converted it into a language of wave forms, it can, in a sense, tumble this internal hologram around and examine it from any perspective it want.
