## Enter the hologram
Order can be hidden in their [[high degree of order]]. Something can be seen as out of [[order]] but in fact just be hidden in "[[disorder]]" when diffused but then reveal the order when reconstructed. Like demonstrated with the drop of ink in glycerine. Then an even more descriptive way of showing order show itself for [[Bohm]], the [[hologram]], almost seemed to be tailor-made for this very purpose. Where the [[interference patterns]] recorded on a piece of [[holographic]] film appear disordered to the naked eye.
