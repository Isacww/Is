## The holographic brain
To [[Pribram]] this can explain a lot. If a piece of [[holographic]] film is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image. Keep dividing the film and the image just get hazier as the portions get smaller, not [[fragment]]ed in parts of the while as one could expect. This is essential for [[memory]] distribution/storage in human [[brain]] since the same feature could explain it he said. As per say, the vision could act the same way aswell. Pribram debunked the one-to-one theory of image/photographic-like projection onto the cortical surface. Neurons are packed together so densely, the expanding ripples of [[electricity]] in the brain - also a [[wave-like]] [[phenomena]] - are constantly crisscrossing one another. When Pribram realized this, that they "almost assuredly" creating an almost and [[kaleidoscopic]] array of [[interference patterns]]. He then reasoned how this could give the brain holographic properties.
