## The undivided wholeness of all things
[[Bohm]]'s theories extends [[Einstein]]'s idea that the world's space and time are not separate entities, but smoothly linked and part of a larger [[whole]] he called the [[space-time continuum]]. Bohm takes this idea way further: He said that **everything** in the [[universe]] is a part of a [[continuum]]. Despite the apparent separateness of things at the [[explicate]] level, everything is a seemless extension of everything else, and ultimately even the [[implicate]] and explicate [[order]]s blend into each other. [[Everything IS the same thing]] - "[[one thing]]". **Unbroken**. One enormous something that extends its uncountable atoms and appendages into all the apparent objects/arms , restless, oceans, and stars. Observe not that universe is a giant undifferentiated mass. Things can be a part of an [[undivided whole]] and still have their own unique qualities. To illustrate Bohm points at little eddies and whirlpools in the river. At glance such appear to be separate things and possesses many individual characteristics like size, rate, and direction of rotation etc. But careful scrutiny reveals that it is impossible to say where the [[whirlpool]] ends and where the river begin. Instead of thinking different aspects of [[holomovement]] "things", he prefer to call them [["relatively independent sub totalities."]] Bohm believes that one universal tendency to [[fragment]] the world and ignore the dynamic [[interconnectedness]] of all things is responsible for many of our problems, not only in science but in our lives and society as well. Examples: extracting valuable parts out of the earth not expecting affects to it as a whole. That it is possible to treat parts of the body and not be concerned with the whole. Dealing with various problems in society, such as crime, poverty, and drug addiction, without addressing societies problems as a whole. --> fragmentation wont work --> extinction of the humans?
