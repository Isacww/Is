## How we construct "World-out-there"
Bodily pain is known to not be in the place of hurt. It is actually a neurophysiological process taking place somewhere in our [[brain]]. How then is our brain able to take the multitude of neurophysiological processes that [[manifest]]s as our experiences, all of which is internal and some are located beyond the confines of our grey matter? -> Creating the [[illusion]] that things are located where they are not - is the quintessential feature of a [[hologram]]. 
[[Pribram]] believes that [[Bekesy]]'s work is compatible with the [[holographic]] view and sheds additional light on how [[interference]] waves fronts - or in Bekesy's case, interfering sources of physical [[vibration]] - enable the brain to localize some of its experiences beyond the physical bounderies of the body.
[[Phantom limb]]: holographic [[memory]] of the limb that is still recorded in the [[interference patterns]] in their brains.
