## NON-Locality
One step further, [[wholeness]] was in some ways the more primary [[reality]].  This explained how [[electron]]s in [[plasmas]], [[superconductivity]] and other specialized states could behave like [[interconnected wholes]]. As [[Bohm]] states: "electrons are not scattered because, through the action of the [[quantum potential]], the whole system is undergoing a co-ordinated movement more like a ballet dance than like a crowd of unorganized people" - "such [[quantum wholeness]] of activity is closer to the kind of unity of functioning of the parts of a machine." An even more surprising feature of the [[quantum]] potential was its implications for the nature of [[location]]. At the level of our everyday lives, things have very specific locations, but Bohm's interpretation of [[quantum physics]] indicated that at the [[subquantum level]], the level in which the quantum potential operated, location ceases to exist. All points in space become equal to all other points in space, and it was meaningless to speak of anything as being separate from anything else. Physicists calls it "[[non-locality]]." This enabled explanation to connection between [[twin particles]] without violating [[special relativity]]'s ban against anything travelling faster than light. 

## Non-locality-visualization
Imagine a fish in an aquarium and that you never seen a fish or an aquarium before and your only knowledge comes from 2 cameras, 1 directed at the front and 1 directed from the side. When looking at the 2 monitors, you might mistakingly assume that the fish on the screens are separate, because of the difference in angles. But as the fish turns and mover simultaneously, you realise a relationship between them. Without the whole full scope of the situation, you might wrongly conclude that the fish are instantaneously communicating with each other. The real reason is because of at a deeper level of [[reality]], the reality of the aquarium, the two dish are actually one and the same. This is what Bohm is saying what happens between [[particle]]s, such as the two [[photon]]s emitted when a positronium atom decays. --> quantum potential permeates all of space, all particles are [[nonlocally interconnected]]. This view is less like when [[subatomic particles]] travel through the void of space, separate from each other, and more like a web where all things are a part of, embedded in a space that was as real and rich with process as the matter that moved through it.
