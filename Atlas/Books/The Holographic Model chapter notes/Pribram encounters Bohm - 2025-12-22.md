## Pribram encounters Bohm
With all things pointing towards that [[reality]] that is "experienced" is in fact just a [[hologram]], then what is it a hologram of? [[Pribram]] then wondered, was it possible that what the mystics had been saying for centuries was true, "reality was [[maya]]", an [[illusion]], and what was out there was really a vast, [[resonating symphony]] of [[wave forms]], a "[[frequency domain]]", that was transformed into the world as we know it only after it entered our senses? This was where [[Bohm]] entered his picture.
