## Key Phrase/Quote
"Metaphysicians should pay attention to quantum mechanics"

## My Connection
Read the book, found some interesting views and introduction to [[electron spin]] and [[photon slits experiment]] which introduced different theories and view upon the potential explanations. 

## Synchronicities
Saw it in a [[youtube]] [[video]] and bought it for myselfg to engage in the [[quantum]] world for the first "conscious time".
 
## Cross-References
It touched upon the dimensional [[enfoldment]] perspective problem. Where something in a lower [[dimension]] cannot easily be viewing something in a higher dimension.

## Next Actions
Could potentially look up and see if [[Peter J. Lewis]] has some interesting books, since this one had some good aspect of showcasing and teaching difficult concepts.
