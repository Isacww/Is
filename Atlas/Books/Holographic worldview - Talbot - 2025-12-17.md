## Key Phrase/Quote
[[people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.]]



## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:

## Overview
Overall simplistic view: [[universe]] is a very complex [[hologram]] - like Leias message to Luke in [[Star Wars]]. Architects of this idea: [[David Bohm]] - an aspiring [[metaphysicist]] that have discussed [[Bohr]]'s world view with [[Einstein]], and [[Karl Pribram]]. Both arriving at this idea independently.

## Main reason for the idea
Inability, many elusive phenomenas now seems to make sense in this perspective. Like [[telepathy]], [[precognition]], mystical feelings of [["oneness" with the universe]], and even [[psychokinesis]], or the ability to move objects without touching.

## Why not researched more?
Science is not prejudice-free. Why is so many of societies greatest insights and advances met with such [[passionate denial]]? [[Siegel]]'s observation: people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.

## Pribram's excitement:
About [[hologram]]s , one of the things that makes holographic possible is [[interference]]. Any wavelike phenomena can create [[interference pattern]], including light - and radio-waves. Hologram are actually already possible. this is a sketch of how an three dimensional hologram is created of an apple through interference, as soon as another laser beam (or in some cases just a bright light source) is shined through the film, a 3-dimensional image appear.
