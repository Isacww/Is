## Key Phrase/Quote
[[people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.]]

[["The brain was using Fourier Mathematics - the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the Fourier Language of Wave Forms"]]

[["reality was maya"]]

## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:

## Overview
Overall simplistic view: [[universe]] is a very complex [[hologram]] - like Leias message to Luke in [[Star Wars]]. Architects of this idea: [[David Bohm]] - an aspiring [[metaphysicist]] that have discussed [[Bohr]]'s world view with [[Einstein]], and [[Karl Pribram]]. Both arriving at this idea independently.

## Main reason for the idea
Inability, many elusive phenomenas now seems to make sense in this perspective. Like [[telepathy]], [[precognition]], mystical feelings of [["oneness" with the universe]], and even [[psychokinesis]], or the ability to move objects without touching.

## Why not researched more?
Science is not prejudice-free. Why is so many of societies greatest insights and advances met with such [[passionate denial]]? [[Siegel]]'s observation: people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.

## Pribram's excitement:
About [[hologram]]s , one of the things that makes holographic possible is [[interference]]. Any wavelike phenomena can create [[interference pattern]], including light - and radio-waves. Hologram are actually already possible. this is a sketch of how an three dimensional hologram is created of an apple through interference, as soon as another laser beam (or in some cases just a bright light source) is shined through the film, a 3-dimensional image appear.

## The holographic brain
To Pribram this can explain a lot. If a piece of holographic film is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image. Keep dividing the film and the image just get hazier as the portions get smaller, not fragmented in parts of the while as one could expect. This is essential for memory distribution/storage in human brain since the same feature could explain it he said. As per say, the vision could act the same way aswell. Pribram debunked the one-to-one theory of image/photographic-like projection onto the cortial surface. Neurons are packed together so densely, the expanding ripples of electricity in the brain - also a wave-like phenominon - are constantly crisscrossing one another. When Pribram realized this, that they "almost assuredly" creating an almost and kaleidoscopic array of interference patterns. He then reasoned how this could give the brain holographic properties.

## Compact memory
[["Thats not all holography can explain."]] It explains how the brain can store so many memories in so little spance. Average human life stores in average 2.8x10^20 bits of information. Which cannot be explained in other means. Holograms possesses fantastic capacity for information storage. By changing the angle at which the two lasers strike a piece of photographic film, it is possible to record many different images on the same surface! Any image thus recorded can be retrieved by illuminating the film with a laser beam at the same angle as when recording that image. This results in: one-inch-square of film can store the dame amount of information as 50 Bibles. So "remembering" is the action of finding the right angle for beam (mind). When the brain has memorized a face, object or scene and converted it into a language of wave forms, it can, in a sense, tumble this internal hologram around and examine it from any perspective it want.

## How we construct "World-out-there"
Bodily pain is known to not be in the place of hurt. It is actually a neurophysiological process taking place somewhere in our brain. How then is our brain able to take the multitude of neurophysiological processes that manifests as our experiences, all of which is internal and some are located beyond the confines of our gray matter? -> Creating the illusion that things are located where they are not - is the quintessential feature of a hologram. 
Pribram believes that Bekesy's work is compatible with the holopraphic view and sheds additional light on how interference waves fronts - or in Bekesy's case, interfering sources of physical vibration - enable the brain to localize some of its experiences beyond the physical bounderies of the body.
[[Phantom limb]]: holographic memory of the limb that is still recorded in the interference patterns in their brains.

## The mathematical language of the hologram
[[Fourier]] : Roughly speaking - mathematical way of converting any pattern, no matter how complex, into a language of simple waves, showed how these wave forms could be converted back into the original pattern. 
[[Fourier transforms]] : images --> wave forms --> image --> ...
In fact, the special whole in every part of a hologram is one of the byproducts that occurrs when an image or pattern is translated into the fourier language of wave forms. Each braincell in the visual complex is geard to respond to a different pattern, some braincells fire when the eyes see a horizontal line, others fire when they see a vertical line, and so on. These cells are called feature detectors. After tests, only one conclusion could be drawn: "The brain was using [[Fourier Mathematics]] - the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the [[Fourier Language]] of [[Wave Forms]]"

[[Brain = Hologram]] : Pribram is convinced of this.

## The dancer as Wave Form
Tests show that out sences are frequency-analyzers. [[Nikolai Bernstein]]'s discovery even showed that our physical movements may be encoded in our brains in a [[Language of Fourier Wave Forms]]. With this he could predict the movements of his subjects to an impressive precision. --> Maybe the brain stores information this way?

## Pribram encounters Bohm
With all things pointing towards that reality that is "experienced" is in fact just a hologram, then what is it a hologram of? Pribram then wondered, was it possible that what the mystics had been saying for centuries was true, "reality was [[maya]]", an illusion, and what was out there was really a vast, [[resonating symphony]] of wave forms, a "[[frequency domain]]", that was transformed into the world as we know it only after it entered our senses? This was where Bohn entered his picture.

## Cosmos as a hologram
An electron cannot solely be defined as a particle, since it also has wave-like qualities. This phenomena of something that somehow embodies both is called "[[quanta]]" and physicists believe that they are the basic stuff from which the entire universe is made. A common way of thinking is that quanta (which is a multiple if a single quantum) only "acts" or transforms into particles when observed. But Bohm thinks differently.

## A living sea of Electrons
At first Bohm also accepted [[Bohr]]'s position, but remained puzzled by the lack of interest Bohr and the rest had towards [[interconnectedness]]. With this, research in [[plasmas]] took place. They are a gas containing a high density of electrons and positive ions (atoms that have a positive charge). Once in the plasma, electrons stopped behaving like individuals and started behaving as if they were part of a larger and interconnected whole. Extending this research he studied electrons in metals. Once again the seemingly haphazard movements of individual electrons managed to produce highly organized overall effects, just like the plasmas, these were no longer situations involving two particles each behaving as if it know what the other was doing, but entire oceans of particles, each behaving as if they know what trillions of others were doing simultaneously. He called it: "[[plasmons]]".
After the conversation about Bohm's interpretation of Bohr's view of quantum domains, with Einstein, it cemented as the conversial belief as the complete description. This did not sit right with Bohm, as its definition could be infinite in its nature. So he continued his exploration, this time not enthusively followed by the rest of scientific communities.

## NON-Locality
One step further, wholeness was in some ways the more primary reality.  This explained how electrons in plasmas, superconductivity and other specialized stats could begave like interconnected wholes. As Bohm states: "electrons are not scattered because, through the action of the [[quantum potential]], the whole system is undergoing a co-ordinated movement more like a ballet dance than like a crowd of unorganized people" - "such quantum wholeness of activity is closer to the kind of unity of functioning of the parts of a machine." An even more surprising feature of the quantum potential was its implications for the nature of location. At the level of our everyday lives, things have very specific locations, but Bohm's interpretation of quantum physics indicated that at the subquantum level, the level in which the quantum potential operated, location ceases to exist. All points in space become equal to all other points in space, and it was meaningless to speak of anything as being seperate from anything else. Physicists calls it "[[non-locality]]." This enabled explanation to connection between [[twin particles]] without violating [[special relativity]]'s ban against anything travelling faster than light. 

## Non-locality-visualization
Imagine a fish in an aquarium and that you never seen a fish or an aquarium before and your only knowledge comes from 2 cameras, 1 directed at the front and 1 directed from the side. When looking at the 2 monitors, you might mistakingly assume that the fish on the screens are seperate, because of the difference in angles. But as the fish turns and mover simultaneously, you realise a relationship between them. Without the whole full scope of the situation, you might wrongly conclude that the fish are instantaneously communicating with each other. The real reason is because of at a deeper level of reality, the reality of the aquarium, the two dish are actually one and the same. This is what Bohm is saying what happens between particles, such as the two photons emitted when a positronium atom decays. --> quantum potential permeates all of space, all particles are nonlocally interconnected. This view is less like when subatomic particles travel through the void of space, seperate from eachother, and more like a web where all things are a part of, embedded in a space that was as real and rich with process as the matter that moved through it.

## Enter the hologram
Order can be hidden in their [[high degree of order]]. Something can be seen as out of order but in fact just be hidden in "[[disorder]]" when diffused but then reveal the order when reconstructed. Like demonstrated with the drop of ink in glycerine. Then an even more descriptive way of showing order show itself for Bohm, **the hologram**, almost seemed to be tailor-made for this very purpose. Where the interference patterns recorded on a piece of holographic film appear disordered to the naked eye.
![[Pasted image 20251217164413.png]]
## Enfolded orders and unfolded realities
One of Bohm's most startling assertions is that the tangible reality is really a kind of illusion, like a holographic image. Underlying it is a deeper order of existence, a vast and more primary level of reality, that gives birth to all the objects and appearances of our physical world, like the way holographic film does to the hologram. Bohm calls this the "[[implicate]]" (which means "[[enfolded]]") [[order]], and our own level of existence as the "[[explicate]]" ([[unfolded]]]) order. Bohm believes an electron is not one thing, but a totality or ensemble enfolded throughout the **whole** of space. When an instrument detects the presence of a single electron, it is simply because one aspect of the electron has unfolded. When it appears to be moving it is due to a [[continuous]] series of such unfoldment and enfoldments. Particles are no more substantive or permanent than the form a geyser of water takes as it gushes out of a fountain, sustained by a constant [[influx]] from the implicate order. The constant flowing between the two orders explains how particles can shape-shift from one kind to another. It also explains how a quantum can manifest as either a particle or a wave. Both are in its ensemble, what the observer interaction, with it, is determines whats being [[manifested]], Like the way a jeweler manipulates a gem determines which of its facets become visible and which does not. Hologram refers to a still image --> Bohm describes the universe as a "[[holomovement]]."
![[Pasted image 20251217170731.png]]
## The undivided wholeness of all things
Bohm's theories extends Einstein's idea that the world's space and time are not separate entities, but smoothly linked and part of a larger whole he called the [[space-time continuum]]. Bohm takes this idea way further: He said that **everything** in the universe is a part of a [[continuum]]. Despite the apparent separateness of things at the explicate level, everything is a seemless extension of everything else, and ultimately even the implicate and explicate orders blend into each other. Everything **IS** the same thing - "[[one thing]]". **Unbroken**. One enormuous something that extends its uncountable atoms and appendages into all the apparent objects/arms , restless, oceans, and stars. Observe not that universe is a giant undifferentiated mass. Things can be a part of an undivided whole and still have their own unique qualities. To illustrate Bohm points at little eddies and whirlpools in the river. At glance such appear to be separate things and possesses many individual characteristics like size, rate, and direction of rotation etc. But careful scrutiny reveals that it is impossible to say where the whirlpool ends and where the river begin. Instead of thinking different aspects of holomovement "things"
## Synchronicities
I have had the feeling and thoughts (intuition) about something interesting about interconnectedness and plasmatic behavior in metals for some reason. Before reading about it. And this is what I thought about [[Lorentz's Law]] was originated from in [[electrodynamics]] and such.
