## Key Phrase/Quote
[[people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.]]



## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:

## Overview
Overall simplistic view: [[universe]] is a very complex [[hologram]] - like Leias message to Luke in [[Star Wars]]. Architects of this idea: [[David Bohm]] - an aspiring [[metaphysicist]] that have discussed [[Bohr]]'s world view with [[Einstein]], and [[Karl Pribram]]. Both arriving at this idea independently.

## Main reason for the idea
Inability, many elusive phenomenas now seems to make sense in this perspective. Like [[telepathy]], [[precognition]], mystical feelings of [["oneness" with the universe]], and even [[psychokinesis]], or the ability to move objects without touching.

## Why not researched more?
Science is not prejudice-free. Why is so many of societies greatest insights and advances met with such [[passionate denial]]? [[Siegel]]'s observation: people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.

## Pribram's excitement:
About [[hologram]]s , one of the things that makes holographic possible is [[interference]]. Any wavelike phenomena can create [[interference pattern]], including light - and radio-waves. Hologram are actually already possible. this is a sketch of how an three dimensional hologram is created of an apple through interference, as soon as another laser beam (or in some cases just a bright light source) is shined through the film, a 3-dimensional image appear.

## The holographic brain
To Pribram this can explain a lot. If a piece of holographic film is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image. Keep dividing the film and the image just get hazier as the portions get smaller, not fragmented in parts of the while as one could expect. This is essential for memory distribution/storage in human brain since the same feature could explain it he said. As per say, the vision could act the same way aswell. Pribram debunked the one-to-one theory of image/photographic-like projection onto the cortial surface. Neurons are packed together so densely, the expanding ripples of electricity in the brain - also a wave-like phenominon - are constantly crisscrossing one another. When Pribram realized this, that they "almost assuredly" creating an almost and kaleidoscopic array of interference patterns. He then reasoned how this could give the brain holographic properties.

## Compact memory
[["Thats not all holography can explain."]] It explains how the brain can store so many memories in so little spance. Average human life stores in average 2.8x10^20 bits of information. Which can be
