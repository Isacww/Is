## Key Phrase/Quote

## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:
Overall simplistic view: [[universe]] is a very complex [[hologram]] - like Leias message to Luke in [[Star Wars]]. Architects of this idea: [[David Bohm]]
