## Key Phrase/Quote
[[people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.]]

[["The brain was using Fourier Mathematics - the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the Fourier Language of Wave Forms"]]

[["reality was maya"]]

## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:



## NON-Locality
One step further, wholeness was in some ways the more primary reality.  This explained how electrons in plasmas, superconductivity and other specialized stats could begave like interconnected wholes. As Bohm states: "electrons are not scattered because, through the action of the [[quantum potential]], the whole system is undergoing a co-ordinated movement more like a ballet dance than like a crowd of unorganized people" - "such quantum wholeness of activity is closer to the kind of unity of functioning of the parts of a machine." An even more surprising feature of the quantum potential was its implications for the nature of location. At the level of our everyday lives, things have very specific locations, but Bohm's interpretation of quantum physics indicated that at the subquantum level, the level in which the quantum potential operated, location ceases to exist. All points in space become equal to all other points in space, and it was meaningless to speak of anything as being seperate from anything else. Physicists calls it "[[non-locality]]." This enabled explanation to connection between [[twin particles]] without violating [[special relativity]]'s ban against anything travelling faster than light. 

## Non-locality-visualization
Imagine a fish in an aquarium and that you never seen a fish or an aquarium before and your only knowledge comes from 2 cameras, 1 directed at the front and 1 directed from the side. When looking at the 2 monitors, you might mistakingly assume that the fish on the screens are seperate, because of the difference in angles. But as the fish turns and mover simultaneously, you realise a relationship between them. Without the whole full scope of the situation, you might wrongly conclude that the fish are instantaneously communicating with each other. The real reason is because of at a deeper level of reality, the reality of the aquarium, the two dish are actually one and the same. This is what Bohm is saying what happens between particles, such as the two photons emitted when a positronium atom decays. --> quantum potential permeates all of space, all particles are nonlocally interconnected. This view is less like when subatomic particles travel through the void of space, seperate from eachother, and more like a web where all things are a part of, embedded in a space that was as real and rich with process as the matter that moved through it.

## Enter the hologram
Order can be hidden in their [[high degree of order]]. Something can be seen as out of order but in fact just be hidden in "[[disorder]]" when diffused but then reveal the order when reconstructed. Like demonstrated with the drop of ink in glycerine. Then an even more descriptive way of showing order show itself for Bohm, **the hologram**, almost seemed to be tailor-made for this very purpose. Where the interference patterns recorded on a piece of holographic film appear disordered to the naked eye.

## Enfolded orders and unfolded realities
One of Bohm's most startling assertions is that the tangible reality is really a kind of illusion, like a holographic image. Underlying it is a deeper order of existence, a vast and more primary level of reality, that gives birth to all the objects and appearances of our physical world, like the way holographic film does to the hologram. Bohm calls this the "[[implicate]]" (which means "[[enfolded]]") [[order]], and our own level of existence as the "[[explicate]]" ([[unfolded]]]) order. Bohm believes an electron is not one thing, but a totality or ensemble enfolded throughout the **whole** of space. When an instrument detects the presence of a single electron, it is simply because one aspect of the electron has unfolded. When it appears to be moving it is due to a [[continuous]] series of such unfoldment and enfoldments. Particles are no more substantive or permanent than the form a geyser of water takes as it gushes out of a fountain, sustained by a constant [[influx]] from the implicate order. The constant flowing between the two orders explains how particles can shape-shift from one kind to another. It also explains how a quantum can manifest as either a particle or a wave. Both are in its ensemble, what the observer interaction, with it, is determines whats being [[manifested]], Like the way a jeweler manipulates a gem determines which of its facets become visible and which does not. Hologram refers to a still image --> Bohm describes the universe as a "[[holomovement]]."

## The undivided wholeness of all things
Bohm's theories extends Einstein's idea that the world's space and time are not separate entities, but smoothly linked and part of a larger whole he called the [[space-time continuum]]. Bohm takes this idea way further: He said that **everything** in the universe is a part of a [[continuum]]. Despite the apparent separateness of things at the explicate level, everything is a seemless extension of everything else, and ultimately even the implicate and explicate orders blend into each other. Everything **IS** the same thing - "[[one thing]]". **Unbroken**. One enormous something that extends its uncountable atoms and appendages into all the apparent objects/arms , restless, oceans, and stars. Observe not that universe is a giant undifferentiated mass. Things can be a part of an [[undivided whole]] and still have their own unique qualities. To illustrate Bohm points at little eddies and whirlpools in the river. At glance such appear to be separate things and possesses many individual characteristics like size, rate, and direction of rotation etc. But careful scrutiny reveals that it is impossible to say where the [[whirlpool]] ends and where the river begin. Instead of thinking different aspects of holomovement "things", he prefer to call them "relatively independent sub totalities." Bohm believes that one universal tendency to fragment the world and ignore the dynamic interconnectedness of all thing is responsible for many of our problems, not only in science but in our lives and society as well. Examples: extracting valuable parts our pf the earth not expecting affects to it as a whole. That it is possible to treat parts of the body and not be concerned with the whole. Dealing with various problems in society, such as crime, poverty, and drug addiction, without addressing societies problems as a whole. --> fragmentation want work --> extinction of the humans?

## Consciousness as a more subtle form of matter
Quantum physics find many examples of interconnectedness when studying matter. Bohm's holographic universe explain many other puzzles. One is the effect consciousness seems to have on the subatomic world. Bohm says its unnecessary to say that consciousness and matter is **interacting**. In a sense the observer **[[is]]** the observed, and also the measurement device, the experimental results, the laboratory. Consciousness is present in various degrees of enfoldment and unfoldment in all matter. As Bohm puts it: " The ability of form to be active is the most characteristic feature of mind, and we have something that is mindlike already with the electron." Also that deciding non-living and living things is meaningless. Just as a hologram contains the image of the whole, every portion of the universe enfolds the whole. This means that if we knew how to access it we would find a different galaxy in our thumbnail, we could also find Cleopatra meeting Caesar for the first time, for in principle the whole past and implications for the whole future are also enfolded in each small region of space and time. Every cell in our body enfolds the entire cosmos. so does every leaf, every raindrop and every dust mote, which gives new meaning to William Blake's poem:

"To see a world in a grain of sand and a Heaven in a wild flower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour."

Bohm believes the same is true at our own level of existence. Space is not empty. It is **full**, a plenum as opposed to a vacuum. And its the ground for the existence of everything, including ourselves. The universe is not separate from this cosmic sea of energy, it is a ripple on its surface, a comparatively small "pattern of excitation" in the midst of an unimaginable vast ocean. "this pattern is relatively autonomous and five rise to approximately recurrent, stable and separable projections into a three-dimensional explicable order of manifistation."
## Pribram and Bohm together
Considered together, Bohm and Pribram's theories provide a profound new way of looking at the world: 
"Our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time; The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe."
## Synchronicities
I have had the feeling and thoughts (intuition) about something interesting about interconnectedness and plasmatic behavior in metals for some reason. Before reading about it. And this is what I thought about [[Lorentz's Law]] was originated from in [[electrodynamics]] and such.
