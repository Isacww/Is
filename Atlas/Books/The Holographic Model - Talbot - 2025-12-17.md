## Key Phrase/Quote
[[people are addicted to their beliefs, which is why addict - like behaviour is prominent when someone is trying to change someone else's beliefs and world-view.]]

[["The brain was using Fourier Mathematics - the same mathematics holography employed to convert visual images into the Fourier Language of Wave Forms"]]

[["reality was maya"]]

## My Connection
I saw a short [[video]] about Talbot shortly describing the view of his and then referring to this book, which peeked my interest.


## Notes:

## Pribram and Bohm together
Considered together, Bohm and Pribram's theories provide a profound new way of looking at the world: 
"Our brains mathematically construct objective reality by interpreting frequencies that are ultimately projections from another dimension, a deeper order of existence that is beyond both space and time; The brain is a hologram enfolded in a holographic universe."
## Synchronicities
I have had the feeling and thoughts (intuition) about something interesting about interconnectedness and plasmatic behavior in metals for some reason. Before reading about it. And this is what I thought about [[Lorentz's Law]] was originated from in [[electrodynamics]] and such.
