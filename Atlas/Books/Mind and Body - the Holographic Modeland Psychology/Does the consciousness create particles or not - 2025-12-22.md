## Does consciousness create subatomic particles or not?
The difference in opinion indicates once again that the [[holographic]] theory is still very much an idea in the making, not unlike a heavily formed pacific island whose volcanic activity keeps it from having clearly defined shores. Also, reveals just how complex a puzzle miracles are. Most physicists have a l-know-its-true-but-will-not-engage attitude that keeps them from considering even the philosophical implications of quantum physics' most incredible findings. Is it possible that our observations of the subatomic world are reality-fields of a kind? Through hypnosis where 2 persons chain hypnosis 2 of them, they could talk to each other in what is described as an other dimension, that was seemingly real-looking, if not even more vibrant than our objective reality. Called some kind of reality-field created between them, and where they said that they were "conjuring" things into existence. Hypnosis is explained through "remote viewing" where the hypnosisits taps into the subjects five senses and can create reality-fields for them. Bohm think the ubiquitousness of meaning offers a possible explanation for both telepathy and remote viewing. Both may actually be just different forms of psychokenisis. Just as PK is a resonance of meaning conveyed from a mind to an object, telepathy can be viewed as a resonance of meaning conveyed from a mind to a mind. "when harmony or resonance of 'meaning' is established, the action works both ways, so that the 'meaning' of the distant system could act in the viewer to produce a kind of inverse psychokenisis that would, in effect, transmit an image of that system to him."
