## I sing the body holographic
The brain can not always determine what's [["out there"]] and what it thinks is "out there." Which is why the [[phantom limb]] [[phenomena]] occurs to amputees. Put in another way, in a [[brain]] that operates holographically, the remembered image of a thing can have as much impact on the senses as the thing itself, which is used in a selective treatments for hard cases of cancer patients. [[Imaginative exercises]] can turn hopelessness to [[miracles]]. Everyone can feel this when imagining somebody we [[love]] and feel a rush in the heart, same goes for anyone who has ever felt their palms grow sweaty after [[conjuring]] up the [[memory]] of some unusually frightening experience. This is strange, but holographically we asserts ALL experiences, whether real or imagined ([[virtual image]], [[real image]]?) are reduced to the same common [[language]] of organized [[wave forms]] - the situations become less puzzling. [[Achterberg]] says: "when images are regarded in the [[holographic]] manner, their [[omnipotent]] influence on physical function logically follows, The image, the behaviour, and the physiological concomitants are a unified aspect of the same phenomenon." Later performed experiments where different subject groups where student learned to increase the number of only one particular type of white cell population, T-cells and more. When learnt the [[imagery]] --> it had a significant increase in the targeted cell types.
**[[Breznits]] found that the stress hormone levels in the soldiers' blood always reflected their estimates and not the actual distance they had marched. Their bodies responded not to reality, but to what they were imagining as reality.** Which also had explains why the placebo effect can have such positive impact.
