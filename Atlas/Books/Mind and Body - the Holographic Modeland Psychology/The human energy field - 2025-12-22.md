## The human energy field
One mystical [[phenomenon]] that appears to involve the ability to see [[reality]]'s [[frequency]] aspects is the [[aura]], or human [[energy field]]. The notion that there is a subtle [[field]] of [[energy]] around the body, a [[halo]]-like  envelope of light that exists just beyond normal human perception, can be found in many ancient traditions. In [[India]], sacred writings that date back to over five thousand years refer to this life energy as "[[Prana]]". In [[China]], since the third millennium B.C. it has been called "[[Ch'i]]" and is believed to be the energy that flows through the [[acupuncture meridiam system]]. [[Kabbalah]], a Jewish mystical philosophy that arose in the sixth century B.C. calls this vital principle "[[nefish]]". and teaches that an "[[egg]]-shaped" bubble of iridescence surrounding every human body. In the book "Future Science" of [[John White]] and [[Stanley Krippner]], listed 97 different cultures that refers to the aura with 97 different names. 

Human energy field has a number of distinct [[layers]], it is believed. These layers are actually said to be three-[[dimension]]al energy bodies that occupy the same space as the physical body but are of increasingly larger size so that they only look like layers, or [[strata]], as they extend outward from the body. 

Many psychics assert that they are [[seven]] main layers, or subtle bodies, each progressively less dense than the one before it, and more difficult to see, They have different names due to different schools of thought. First four refers to the [[etheric]] body; the [[astral]], or the emotional body; the mental body, and the [[cansal]], or intuitive body. It is generally believed that the etheric body, that is closest in size to the physical body, is a kind of energy blueprint and is involved in guiding and shaping the growth of the physical body. And the next three are related to emotional, mental, and intuitive processes. Virtually agrees on what to call the next three, but commonly agreed that they have to do with the [[soul]] and higher [[spiritual functioning]].

According to Indian [[yogic]] literature, we have special [[energy center]]s in our body. There [[focal points of subtle energy]] are connected to [[endocrine glands]] and major nerve centers in the physical body, but also extend up and into the energy field. Because they resemble spinning [[vortices]] of energy when they are looked at head-on, [[yogic literature]] refers to them as [[chakra]]s, from the [[sanskrit word for "wheel."]]

the [[crown chakra]], an important chakra that originates in the upper most tip of the brain and is associated with [[spiritual awakening]], is often described by [[clairvoyant]]s as looking like a little  [[cyclone]] whirling in the energy field on top of the head. It is wondered by [[Talbot]] if it refers to what apostle Luke was seeing when he described the "[[flame of the Pentecost]]," the [[tongues of fire]] that appeared on the heads of the apostles when the [[Holy Ghost]] descended on them.

## Seeing the human energy field
A health professional who lectures widely about the human energy field is University of southern California heart and lung specialist [[W. Brush Joy]]. Instead of seeing the aura, Joy initially was only able to feel its presence with his hands. "I was examining a healthy male in his early twenties," - As my hand padded over the [[solar plexus]] area, the pit of the stomach, I sensed something that felt like a warm cloud. It seems to radiate out three to four feet from the body, perpendicular to the surface and to be shaped lie a cylinder about four inches in diameter." Joy went on to discover that all his patients had palpable [[cylinder-like radiations]] examining not only from their stomachs, but from various point on their bodies. It was not until he read an ancient Hindy book about the human energy system that he found that he had discovered, or rather rediscovered, the chakras. Even Joy thinks the [[holographic]] model offers the best explanation for understanding the human energy field. He also believes that the ability to see auras is latent in all of us, "I believe that reaching expanded stated of [[consciousness]] is merely the [[attuning]] of our [[central nervous system]] to perceptive states that have always existed in us but have been blocked by our [[outer mental conditioning]]." 

To prove his point, Joy now spends most of his time teaching others how to sense the human energy field. One of his students is Michael Crichton, author of "The andromeda Strain" and "Sphere" that describes in a fictionally twist how he is transformed by the experience and it is clear that this body energy is a genuine [[phenomenon]] of some kind.
