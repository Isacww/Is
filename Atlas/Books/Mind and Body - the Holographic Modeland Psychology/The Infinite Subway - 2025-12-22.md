## The infinite [[subway]]
[[Grof]] studied patients with repeated [[LSD]] treatment which "let them tap into all sorts of lifeforms, embody them and then being able to talk about it as if they had lived as them," everything from past humans to plants, animals and planets, inside their mothers womb and inanimate objects. All backed up if possible. Volunteers of all sorts from all different professions and life-styles. "LSD provided the human [[consciousness]] with access to a kind of [[infinite subway system]], a labyrinth of tunnels and byways that existed in the sub-terranean reaches of the [[unconscious]], and one that litterley connected everything in the [[universe]] with everything else." Grof said that he had no doubt after 3000-five-hour sessions of data and 2000 more from collegues, that there is an urgent need for drastic revision of existing [[paradigms]] for psychology, psychiatry, medicine, and possible science in general, no doubt in his mind that our current understanding of the universe, of the nature of "[[reality]] and particularly of human being, is superficial, incorrect and incomplete." He call it [[transpersonal]] to describe this [[phenomena]], experiences in which the consciousness transcends the customary bounderies of the personality. Now this area of research is called: [[transpersonal psychology]]. Even he see the [[holographic]] theory to explain what he saw. Grof developed a nondrug [[holotropic therapy]] to achieve the experiences through body work such as: rapid controlled breathing, evocative music, and massage to enduce altered states of consciousness with much success. His work is detailed in the book: "[[The adventure of self-discovery]]"
