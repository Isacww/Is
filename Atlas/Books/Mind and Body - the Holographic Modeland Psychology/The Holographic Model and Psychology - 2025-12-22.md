## The holographic model and psychology
[[Jung]] had theories of [[unconscious]] visions being connected with [[hallucinations]] and [[schizophrenia]] to spring from one single source, that we all share, a [[collective unconsciousness]]. Later he found described [[phenomena]] from seemingly separate sources, patients in psyche-care describing things that can be found in older scripts like a translation two-thousand-year-old Persian religious text that described a series of rituals and invocations designed to bring visions. One of the visions, was a tube hanging down from the [[sun]] when looking at it, making the wind blow when swinging side-to-side. He called these visions "[[archetypes]]", and is so ancient it's as if each of us has the [[memory]] of a two-thousand-year-old man lurking somewhere in the depths of our [[unconscious]] [[mind]]s. [[Bohm]]: "Deep down the [[consciousness]] mankind [[is]] one." No matter how [[fragment]]ed a person is, [[Ullman]] believes that [[dream]]s will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth. He believes its more than just for the wellbeing of the individual, but that nature is concerned with the species' survival. He also agrees with Bohm on the importance of [[wholeness]] and feels that dreams are nature's way of faying to counteract our seemingly unending [[compulsion]] to fragment the world. "An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. Unless we, the human race, nationally, religiously, economically or whatever, we are going to continue to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the [[whole picture]]," - Ullman
Schizophrenic persons could have glimpses into this [[implicate]] [[wholeness]] and try to convey this, but for them it is as if they share thoughts with others and see things like: "Event A follows event B" as the same as "Event B follows event A". All time sequences is not meaningful since all points in time are equal. Same foes for spacial relations ([[non-locality]]?).
