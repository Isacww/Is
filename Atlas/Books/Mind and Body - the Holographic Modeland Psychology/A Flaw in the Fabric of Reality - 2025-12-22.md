## A flaw in the fabric of reality
Another of [[Jung]]'s great contributions was defining the concept of [[synchronicity]]. They reveal the absence of division between the physical world and our inner psychological [[reality]]. Thus the relative scarcity of synchronous experiences in our lives show not only the extent to which we have [[fragment]]ed ourselves from the general [[field of consciousness]] but also the degree to which we have sealed ourselves off from the infinite and dazzling potential of the deeper [[order]]s of [[mind]] and reality.
"Synchronicity is coincidences that are so unusual and so meaningful they hardly could be attributed to chance alone."
Like Jung's scarab story, pointing to a rebirth of his patient during painstaking sessions. He said that they almost always accompanied periods of emotional intensity and transformation: [[fundamental changes in beliefs]], [[sudden and new insights]], deaths, births and even changes in profession. "is the human mind operating, for a moment, in its true order and extending throughout society and nature moving through orders of increasing subtletly, reaching past the source of mind and matter into creativity itself."

## Synchronicities
Describing Jung's definition of synchronicities make me think of the biblical saying "[[road to Damascus]]".
