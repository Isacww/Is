## The law of physics and realities both potential and real
The [[Jansenists]] in [[France]] around 1600s where said to be invulnerable to a miraculous extent. But one conundrum remained, where did the [[energy]] from the hammer into the belly go? For example that is. And the fire that was supposed to melt the humans? But if [[consciousness]] can mediate directly in the [[implicate]] [[order]], it becomes a more traceable problem. It could result from activity on an even more fundamental level and involve the processes that create both the physical [[universe]] and the laws of physics in the first place. Looked in a different way, the ability of consciousness to shift from one entire [[reality]] or another suggests that the usually inviolate rule that "fire burns human flesh" may only be one program in the cosmic computer but a program that has been repeated so often it has become one of nature's habits. As has been mentioned according to the [[holographic]] idea [[matter]] is also a kind of [[habit]] and is constantly born anew out of the implicate just as the shape of a fountain is created anew our of the constant flow of [[water]] that gives it form. Peat: "When you have a neurosis you tend to repeat the same pattern in your life or do the same action as if there's a [[memory]] built up and the thing is stuck with that," he says: "I tend to think things like chairs and tables are like that also. Material neurosis, a repetition. But a subtly constant enfolding and unfolding." In this sense chairs and tables are just habits in this [[flux]], but the flux is the reality, even if we tend to just see the habits. Given that the universe and the laws of [[physics]] that govern it are also products of this flux, then they to, must be viewed as habits. Clearly deeply ingrained habits in the [[holomovement]], but supernormal talent such as immunity to dire indicate that, despite their seeming constancy, at least some of the rules that govern the reality can be suspended. This means that the laws of physics are not set in stone, but more like [[Shainberg]]'s [[vortices]], [[whirlpool]]s of such vast inertial power that they are fixed in the holomovement as our own habits and deeply held convictions are fixed in our thought. [[Grof]]'s proposal that altered states of consciousness may be required in order to make such changes in the implicate is also attested to by the [[frequency]] with which fire immunity is associated with hightened [[faith]] and [[religious]] zeal. The pattern is increasingly clear the deeper and more emotionally charged our beliefs, the greater the changes we can make in both our bodies and reality itself.
