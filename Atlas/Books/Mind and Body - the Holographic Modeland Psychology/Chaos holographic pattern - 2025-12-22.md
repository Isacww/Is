## Chaos Holographic patterns
[[Valerie Hunt]], physical therapist and professor of kinesiology developed a way to confirm experimentally the existence of the human [[energy field]]. An [[electromyograph]] can pick up the [[electrical presence]] of it. Hunt also discovered that when an [[aura]] reader saw a particular colour in a persons energy field, the electromyograph always picked up a specific pattern of [[frequencies]] that Hunt learned associates with that colour. She was able to see this pattern on an [[oscilloscope]], device that converts electrical waves into a visual patten on a [[monochromatic video display]]. "It was right down the line." She also adapted the [[holographic]] model as to explain why the body's electrical system seem to have the same [[frequency]] and pattern in the whole body, but its stronger and higher amplitude in the heart like the whole partitioning in the holographic field [[reality]]. Although every portion of what she calls the "[[Holographic field reality]]" of the aura contains aspects of the whole energy field, different portions are not absolutely identical to each other. These differing amplitudes keep the energy field from being a static [[hologram]], and instead allow it to be dynamic and flowing.

Another of Hunt's discoveries involves the new science of [[chaos]]. The [[phenomena]] that can be seen to be a process that is so [[haphazard]] they do not appear to be governed by any laws. For example: When smoke rises from an extinguished candle it flows upwards in a thin and narrow stream. Eventually the structure of the stream breaks down and becomes turbulent, its chaotic since its [[behaviour can no longer be predicted by science]]. Other examples of chaotic phenomena include [[water]] when it [[crashes at the bottom of a waterfall]], also the seemingly random [[electrical fluctuation]] that rage through the [[brain]] of an epileptic during a [[seizure]], and the weather when several different temperature and air pressure fronts collide. Science has discovered that many chaotic phenomena are not as [[disorder]]ed as they seem and often contain [[hidden patterns]] and [[regularities]] (recall [[Bohm]]'s assertion that there is no such thing as disorder, only [[order]]s of indefinitely high degrees). Scientists have also discovered mathematical ways of finding some of the regularities that lie hidden in chaotic phenomena.

One of these involves a special kind of mathematical analysis that can convert data about a chaotic phenomena into a shape on a computer screen. If the data contains no hidden patterns, the resulting shape will be a straight line. Otherwise if it contains hidden regularities, the shape will look like some a the [[spiral]] design children make by winding coloured yarn around an array of nails into a board. ([[369]] [[vortices]]??). These are called "chaos patterns" or "[[strange attractors]]" (because the lines that compose the shape seem to be attracted again and again to certain areas of the screen, just as the yarn might be said to be repeatedly "attracted" to the array of nails around which it is wound). (sound also like 369-like vortices patterns).

When Hunt observed energy field data on the oscilloscope, she noticed that if changed constantly. Sometimes it come in great clumps, sometimes it waned and became patchy, as if the energy field itself were in an[[ unceasing state of fluctuation]]. At first these seemed [[random]] but Hunt sensed some order. She ran various tests with data in [[EKG]], [[EMG]], [[EEG]], --> NO CHAOS PATTERNS. BUT when they analyzed the very high frequencies of the field they met success. "we got the most [[dynamic chaos pattens]] you ever saw." This meant that although the kaleidoscopic changes taking place in the energy field appeared to be random, they were [[actually very highly ordered and rich with patterns]]. [["The pattern is never a repeatable one, but it's so dynamic and complex, I call it a chaos holograph pattern."]] Hunt believes her discovery was the first true chaos pattern to be found in a [[major electrobiological system]]. Recently researchers have found chaos patterns in EEG recordings of the [[brain]], but they needed MANY MINUTES of data from NUMEROUS ELECTRODES to obtain such a pattern. Hunt obtained aa chaos pattern from three or four seconds of data recorded by ONE ELECTRODE, suggesting that the human energy field is far richer in information and possesses a far more complex and dynamic organization than even the electrical activity of the brain.
