## Seeing Holographically
We as human beings consider ourselves to be made up of "solid [[matter]]." Actually, the physical body is the end product, so to speak, of the subtle information fields, which mold our physical body as well as all physical matter. These [[fields]] are [[holograms]] which change in time (and are) outside the reach of our normal senses. This is what [[clairvoyants]] perceive as colourful [[egg]]-shaped [[halos]] or [[auras]] surrounding our physical bodies. -- [[Itzhak Bentov]], stalking the wild pendulum

When the [[mind]] is so accustomed to see something, our [[unconscious]] edit inconsistencies we perceive that deviate to what is expected for us to see. The eye/[[brain]] is not a faithful camera and tinkers with the world before it gives it to us. [[Pribram]] saw that a monkey receive visual information via its optic nerves that travel through filters in other areas of the brain BEFORE entering the visual cortex. Numerous studies points to the same in human vision. Areas like our temporal lobes and some studies show suggestive data that less tan 50% of what we "see" is actually based on information entering our eyes. Remaining 50% is pieced together out of our expectations of what the world "should" look like (and perhaps out of other sources such as [[reality-fields]]). We are so used to responding to what we think is there, we don't always see what really is there. Example of this is the eye's so-called blind-spot. The brain artfully fills in the gaps like a skilled tailor reweaving a hole in a piece of fabric what is all the more remarkable is that it reweaves the tapestry of our visual [[reality]] so masterfully we are not even aware that its doing so. This leads to the query: If we are seeing less than half of what is our there, what is our there that we are not seeing? What blind spots are escaping our attention completely? Through [[technology]] we see examples: spiderwebs looks drab and white to us, but the ultra-violet-sensitive eyes of the insects for when they are designed for, they are actually brightly coloured and hence alluring. Also, fluorescent lamps do not [[continuously]] provide light, but flickering at a rate not comprehensible for us to discern. But are there other important aspects of reality that we are not seeing, beyond even our technical grasp? According to the [[holographic]] model, the answer is YES. In [[Pribram]]'s view reality at large is really a [[frequency domain]], and our brain is a kind of lens that converts these [[frequencies]] into the objective world appearances. Through frequencies of our normal sensory world were his origin, like sound and light, he now uses "frequency domain" to refer to the [[interference pattern]] that compose the [[implicate]] [[order]]. He believes there is much not discerned from this domain thing that our brains have learned to edit our regularly of our visual reality. And when mystics have transcendental experiences , what is really done is catching glimpses of the frequency domain. "mystical experience makes sense when one can provide the mathematical formulas that take one back and forth between the ordinary world, or 'image-object' domain and the frequency domain."
