## Psychokinesis
[[Dunne]] propose that [[psychokinesis]] (PK) actually involves an exchange of information between [[consciousness]] and physical [[reality]], an exchange that should be thought of less as a flow between the mental and the material, and more as a "[[resonance]]" between the two. The importance of resonance was even sensed and commented on by the volunteers in the PK experiments, in that the most frequently mentioned factor associated with a successful performance was the attainment of a feeling of "resonance" with the machine. One volunteer described the feeling as "a state of immersion in the process which leads to a less of awareness of myself. I don't feel any direct control over the device, more like a marginal influence when I'm in resonance with the machine. It's like being a canoe; when it foes where I want, I flow with it. When it doesn't I try to break the flow and give it a chance to get back in resonance with me."
