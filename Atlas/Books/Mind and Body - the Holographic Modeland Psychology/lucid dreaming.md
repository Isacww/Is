## Lucid dreaming and parallel universes
Physicist [[Fred Alan Wolf]] asserted that [[holographic]] may help explain the unusual [[phenomena]] of [[lucid dreaming]]. Where the subject is awake and aware in the [[dream]] leading to ability of control and impact in the dream. He points our that a piece of [[holographic]] film actually generates two images, a [[virtual image]] that appears to be in the space behind the film, and a [[real image]] that comes into focus in the space in front of the film. Difference is the light waves that compose a virtual image seem to be delivering **FROM** an apparent focus or source. As we have seen, this is an [[illusion]], for the virtual image of a [[hologram]] has no more extension in space than does the image in a mirror. But the real image is formed by light waves that are coming **TO** a focus, and this is NOT an [[illusion]] and DOES posses extension in space. Little attention is paid to this rea, image that comes into focus in empty air because its invisible and can only be seen when dust particles pass through it, or when someone blows a puff of smoke through it. Wolf believes that all dreams are internal holograms, and ordinary dreams are less vivid because they are virtual images. However, he thinks the [[brain]] also has the ability to generate real images, and that is exactly what it does when we are dreaming lucidly. The unusual vibrancy of the lucid dream is due to the fact that the waves are [[converging]] NOT [[diverging]]. "If there is a 'viewer' where these waves focus, that viewer will be bathed in the scene, and the scene coming to fucus will 'contain' him" --> Experienced 'lucid'.
