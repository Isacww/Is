## Key Phrase/Quote
[["Deep down the consciousness mankind is one."]]

No matter how fragmented a person is, [[Ullman]] believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth.

"our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world"

## My Connection
Second part of the book I read: "Holographic  Model of the Universe" written by Talbot.

## Notes:

## The holographic model and psychology
[[Jung]] had theories of [[unconscious]] visions being connected with [[hallucinations]] and [[schizophrenia]] to spring from one single source, that we all share, a [[collective unconsciousness]]. Later he found described phenomen from seemingly separate sources, patients in psyche-care describing things that can be found in older scripts like a translation two-thousand-year-old persian religious text that described a series of rituals and invocations designed to bring visions. One of the visions, was a tube hanging down from the sun when looking at it, making the wind blow when swinging side-to-side. He called these visions "[[archetypes]]", and is so ancient it's as if each of us has the memory of a two-thousand-year-old man lurking somewhere in the depths of our unconscious minds. [[Bohm]]: "Deep down the consciousness mankind is one." No matter how fragmented a person is, [[Ullman]] believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth. He believes its more than just for the wellbeing of the individual, but that nature is concerned with the species' survival. He also agrees with Bohm on the importance of [[wholeness]] and feels that dreams are nature's way of faying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world. "An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. Unless we, the human race, nationally, religiously, economically or whatever, we are going to continue to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the [[whole picture]]," - Ullman
Schizophrenic persons could have glimpses into this implicate wholeness and try to convey this, but for them it is as if they share thoughts with others and see things like: "Event A follows event B" as the same as "Event B follows event A". All time sequences is not meaningful since all points in time are equal. Same foes for spacial relations ([[non-locality]]?).

## Lucid dreaming and parallel universes
Physicist [[Fred Alan Wolf]] asserted that [[holographic]] may help explain the unusual phenomenon of [[lucid dreaming]]. Where the subject is awake and aware in the dream leading to ability of control and impact in the dream. He points our that a piece of holographic film actually generates two images, a [[virtual image]] that appears to be in the space behind the film, and a [[real image]] that comes into focus in the space in front of the film. Difference is the light waves that compose a virtual image seem to be delivering **FROM** an apparent focus or source. As we have seen, this is an [[illusion]], for the virtual image of a [[hologram]] has no more extension in space than does the image in a mirror. But the real image is formed by light waves that are coming **TO** a focus, and this is NOT an illusion and DOES posses extension in space. Little attention is paid to this rea, image that comes into focus in empty air because its invisible and can only be seen when dust particles pass through it, or when someone blows a puff of smoke through it. Wolf believes that all dreams are internal holograms, and ordinary dreams are less vivid because they are virtual images. However, he thinks the brain also has the ability to generate real images, and that is exactly what it does when we are dreaming lucidly. The unusual vibrancy of the lucid dream is due to the fact that the waves are [[converging]] NOT [[diverging]]. "If there is a 'viewer' where these waves focus, that viewer will be bathed in the scene, and the scene coming to fucus will 'contain' him" --> Experienced 'lucid'.

## The infinite [[subway]]
[[Grof]] studied patients with repeated [[LSD]] treatment which "let them tap into all sorts of lifeforms, embody them and then being able to talk about it as if they had lived as them," everything from past humans to plants, animals and planets, inside their mothers womb and inanimate objects. All backed up if possible. Volunteers of all sorts from all different professions and life-styles. "LSD[[ provided the human consciousness]] with access to a kind of [[infinite subway system]], a labyrinth of tunnels and byways that existed in the sub-terranean reaches of the unconscious, and one that litterley connected everything in the universe with everything else." Grof Said that he had no doubt after 3000-five-hour sessions of data and 2000 more from collegues, that there is an urgent need for drastic revision of existing paradigms for psychology, psychiatry, medicine, and possible science in general, no doubt in his mind that our current understanding of the universe, of the nature of "[[reality]] and particularly of human being, is superficial, incorrect and incomplete." He call it [[transpersonal]] to describe this phenomena, experiences in which the consciousness transcends the customary bounderies of the personality. Now this area of research is called: [[transpersonal psychology]]. Even he see the [[holographic]] theory to explain what he saw. Grof developed a nondrug [[holotropic therapy]] to achieve the experiences through body work such as: rapid controlled breathing, evocative music, and massage to enduce altered states of consciousness with much success. His work is detailed in the book: "[[The adventure of self-discovery]]"

## A flaw in the fabric of [[reality]]
Another of [[Jung]]'s great contributions was defining the concept of [[synchronicity]]. They reveal the absence of division between the physical world and our inner psychological reality. Thus the relative scarcity of synchronous experiences in our lives show not only the extent to which we have fragmented ourselves from the general [[field of consciousness]] but also the degree to which we have sealed ourselves off from the infinite and dazzling potential of the [[deeper orders of mind and reality]].
"Synchronicity is coincidences that are so unusual and so meaningful they hardly could be attributed to chance alone."
Like Jung's scarab story, pointing to a rebirth of his patient during painstaking sessions. He said that they almost always accompanied periods of emotional intensity and transformation: [[fundamental changes in beliefs]], [[sudden and new insights]], deaths, births and even changes in profession. "is the human mind operating, for a moment, in its true order and extending throughout society and nature moving through orders of increasing subtletly, reaching past the source of mind and matter into creativity itself."

## I sing the body [[holographic]]
The brain can not always determine what's [["out there"]] and what it thinks is "out there." Which is why the [[phantom limb]] phenomenon occurs to amputees. Put in another way, in a brain that operates holographically, the remembered image of a thing can have as much impact on the senses as the thing itself, which is used in a selective treatments for hard cases of cancer patients. [[Imaginative exercises]] can turn hopelessness to [[miracles]]. Everyone can feel this when imagining somebody we love and feel a rush in the heart, same goes for anyone who has ever felt their palms grow sweaty after conjuring up the memory of some unusually frightening experience. This is strange, but holographically we asserts ALL experiences, whether real or imagined ([[virtual image]], [[real image]]?) are reduced to the same common language of organized wave forms - the situations become less puzzling. Achterberg says: "when images are regarded in the holographic manner, their omnipotent influence on physical function logically follows, The image, the behaviour, and the physiological concomitants are a unified aspect of the same phenomenon." Later performed experiments where different subject groups where student learned to increase the number of only one particular type of white cell population, T-cells and more. When learnt the [[imagery]] --> it had a significant increase in the targeted cell types.
**[[Breznits]] found that the stress hormone levels in the soldiers' blood always reflected their estimates and not the actual distance they had marched. Their bodies responded not to reality, but to what they were imagining as reality.** Which also had explains why the placebo effect can have such positive impact. 

## Psychokinesis
Dunne propose that psychokinesis (PK) actually involves an exchange of information between consciousness and physical reality, an exchange that should be thought of less as a flow between the mental and the material, and more as a "resonance" between the two. The importance of resonance was even sensed and commented on by the volunteers in the PK experiments, in that the most frequently mentioned factor associated with a successful performance was the attainment of a feeling of "resonance" with the machine. One volunteer described the feeling as "a state of immersion in the process which leads to a less of awareness of myself. I don't feel any direct control over the device, more like a marginal influence when I'm in resonance with the machine. It's like being a canoe; when it foes where I want, i flow with it. When it doesn't I try to break the flow and give it a chance to get back in resonance with me."

## The law of physics and realities both potential and real
The Jansenists in France around 1600s where said to be invulnerable to a miraculous extent. But one conundrum remained, where did the energy from the hammer into the belly go? For example that is. And the fire that was supposed to melt the humans? But if consciousness can mediate directly in the implicate order, it becomes a more traceable problem. It could result from activity on an even more fundamental level and involve the processes that create both the physical universe and the laws of physics in the first place. Looked in a different way, the ability of consciousness to shift from one entire reality or another suggests that the usually inviolate rule that "fire burns human flesh" may only be one program in the cosmic computer but a program that has been repeated so often it has become one of nature's habits. As has bee  mentioned according to the holographic idea matter is also a kind of habit and is constantly born anew out of the implicate just as the shape of a fountain is created anew our of the constant flow of water that gives it form. Peat: "When you have a neurosis you tend to repeat the same pattern in your life or do the same action as if there's a memory built up and the thing is stuck with that," he says: "I tend to think things like chairs and tables are like that also. Material neurosis, a repetition. But a subtly constant enfolding and unfolding." In this sense chairs and tables are just habits in this flux, but the flux is the reality, even id we tend to just see the habits. Fiven that the universe and the laws of physics that govern it are also products of this flux, then they to, must be viewed as habits. Clearly deeply ingrained habits in the holomovement, but supernormal talent such as immunity to dire indicate that, despite their seeming constancy, at least some of the rules that govern the reality can be suspended. This means that the laws of physics are not set in stone, but more like Shainberg's vortices, whirlpools of such vast inertial power that they are fixed in the holomovement as our own habits and deeply held convictions are fixed in our thought. Grof's proposal that altered states of consciousness may be required in order to make such changes in the implicate is also attested to by the frequency with which fir immunity is associated with hightened faith and religious zeal. The pattern is increasingly clear the deeper and more emotionally charged our beliefs, the greater the changes we can make in both our bodies and reality itself.

## Does consciousness create subatomic particles or not?
The difference in opinion indicates once again that the holographic theory is still very much an idea in the making, not unlike a heavily formed pacific island whose volcanic activity keeps it from having clearly defined shores. Also, reveals just how complex a puzzle miracles are. Most physicists have a l-know-its-true-but-will-not-engage attitude that keeps them from considering even the philosophical implications of quantum physics' most incredible findings. Is it possible that our observations of the subatomic world are reality-fields of a kind? Through hypnosis where 2 persons chain hypnosis 2 of them, they could talk to each other in what is described as an other dimension, that was seemingly real-looking, if not even more vibrant than our objective reality. Called some kind of reality-field created between them, and where they said that they were "conjuring" things into existence. Hypnosis is explained through "remote viewing" where the hypnosisits taps into the subjects five senses and can create reality-fields for them. Bohm think the ubiquitousness of meaning offers a possible explanation for both telepathy and remote viewing. Both may actually be just different forms of psychokenisis. Just as PK is a resonance of meaning conveyed from a mind to an object, telepathy can be viewed as a resonance of meaning conveyed from a mind to a mind. "when harmony or resonance of 'meaning' is established, the action works both ways, so that the 'meaning' of the distant system could act in the viewer to produce a kind of inverse psychokenisis that would, in effect, transmit an image of that system to him."

## Seeing Holographically
We as human beings consider ourselves to be made up of "solid matter." Actually, the physical body is the end product, so to speak, of the subtle information fields, which mold our physical body as well as all physical matter. These fields are holograms which change in time (and are) outside the reach of our normal senses. This is what clairvoyants perceive as colorful egg-shaped halos or auras surrounding our physical bodies. -- Itzhak Bentov, stalking the wild pendulum

When the mind is so accustomed to see something, our unconscious edit inconsistencies we perceive that deviate to what is expected for us to see. The eye/brain is not a faithful camera and tinkers with the world before it gives it to us. Pribram saw that a monkey receive visual information via its optic nerves that travel through filters in other areas of the brain BEFORE entering the visual cortex. Numerous studies points to the same in human vision. Areas like our temporal lobes and some studies show suggestiv data that less tan 50% of what we "see" is actually based on information entering our eyes. Remaining 50% is pieced together our of our expectations of what the world "should" look like (and perhaps our of other sources such as reality fields). We are so used to responding to what we think is there, we don't always see what really is there. Example of this is the eye's so-called blind-spot. The brain artfully fills in the gaps like a skilled tailor reweaving a hole in a piece of fabric what is all the more remarkable is that it reweaves the tapestry of our visual reality so masterfully we are not even aware that its doing so. This leads to the query: If we are seeing less than half of what is our there, what is our there that we are not seeing? What blind spots are escaping our attention completely? Through technology we see examples: spiderwebs looks drab and white to us, but the ultra-violet-sensitive eyes of the insects for when they are designed for, they are actually brightly coloured and hence alluring. Also, fluorescent lamps do not continuously provide light, but flickering ar a rate not comprehensible for us to discern. But are there other important aspects of reality that we are not seeing, beyond even our technical grasp? According to the holographic model, the answer is YES. In Pribrams view reality at large is really a frequency domain, and our brain is a kind of lens that converts these frequencies into the objective world appearances. Through frequencies of our normal sensory world were his origin, like sound and light, he now uses "frequency domain" to refer to the interference pattern that compose the implicate order. He believes there is much not discerned from this domain thing that our brains have learned to edit our regularly of our visual reality. And when mystics have transcendental experiences , what is really dine is catching glimpses of the frequency domain. "mystical experience makes sense when one can provide the mathematical formulas that take one back and forth between the ordinary world, or 'image-object' domain and the frequency domain."

## The human energy field
One mystical phenomenon that appears to involve the ability tot see reality's frequency aspects is the aura, or human energy field. The notion that there is a subtle field of energy around the body, a halo-like  envelope of light that exists just beyond normal human perception, can be found in many ancient traditions. In India, sacred writings that date back to over five thousand years refer to this life energy as "Prana". In China, since the third millennium B.C. it has been called "Ch'i" and is believed to be the energy that flows through the acupuncture meridiam system. Kabbalah, a Jewish mystical philosophy that arose in the sixth century B.C. calls this vital principle "nefish". and teaches that an "egg-shaped" bubble of iridescence surrounding every human body. In the book "Future Science" of John White and Stanley Krippner, listed 97 different cultures that refers to the aura with 97 different names. 

Human energy field has a number of distinct layers, it is believed. These layers are actually said to be three-dimensional energy bodies that occupy the same space as the physical body but are of increasingly larger size so that they only look like layers, or strata, as they extend outward from the body. 

Many psychics assert that they are seven main layers, or subtle bodies, each progressively less dence than the one before it, and more difficult to see, They have different names dur to different schools of thought. First four refers to the ethric body; the astral, or the emotional body; the mental body, and the cansal, or intuitive body. It is generally believed that the etheric body, that is closest in size to the physical body, is a kind of energy blueprint and is involved in quiding and shaping the growth of the physical body. And the next three are related to emotional, mental, and intuitive processes. Virtually agrees on what to call the next three, but commonly agreed that they have to do with the soul and higher spiritual functioning.

According to Indian Yogic literature, we have special energy centers in our body. There focal points of subtle energy are connected to endocrine glands and major nerve centers in the physical body, but also extend up and into the energy field. Because they resemble spinning vortices of energy when they are looked at head-on, yogic literature refers to them as chakras, from the sanskrit word for "wheel."

the crown chakra, an important chakra that originates in the upper most tip of the brain and is associated with spiritual awakening, is often described by clairvoyants as looking like a little  cyclone whirling in the energy field on top of the head. It is wondered by Talbot if it refers to what apostle Like was seeing when he described the "flame of the Pentecost," the tongues of fire that appeared on the heads of the apostles when the Holy Ghost descended on them.

## Seeing the human energy field
A health professional who lectures widely about the human energy field is University of southern California heart and lung specialist [[W. Brush Joy]]. Instead of seeing the aura, Joy initially was only able to feel its presence with his hands. "I was examining a healthy make in his early twenties," - As my hand padded over the [[solar plexus]] area, the pit of the stomach, I sensed something that felt lika a warm cloud. It seems to radiate out three to four feet from the body, perpendicular to the surface and to be shaped lie a cylinder about four inches in diameter." Joy went on to discover that all his patients had palpable cylinder-like radiations examining not only from their stomachs, but from various point on their bodies. It was not until he read an ancient Hindy book about the human energy system that he found that he had discovered, or rather rediscovered, the chakras. Even Joy thinks the holographic model offers the best explanation for understanding the human energy field. He also believes that the ability to see auras is latent in all of us, "I believe that reaching expanded stated of consciousness is merely the attuning of our central nervous system to perceptive states that have always existed in us but have been blocked by our outer mental conditioning." 

To prove his point, Joy now spends most of his time teaching others how to sense the human energy field. One of his students is Michael Crichton, author of "The andromeda Strain" and "Sphere" that describes in a fictionally twist how he is transformed by the experience and it is clear that this body energy is a genuine phenomenon of some kind.

## Chaos Holographic patterns
Valerie Hunt, physical therapist and professor of kinesiology developed a way to confirm experimentally the existence of the human energy field. An electromyograph can pick up the electrical presence of it. Hunt also discovered that when an aura reader saw a particular colour in a persons energy field, the electromyograph always picked up a specific pattern of frequencies that Hunt learned associates with that colour. She was able to see this pattern on an oscilloscope, device that converts electrical waves into a visual patten on a monochromatic video display. "It was right down the line." She also adapted the holographic model as to explain why the body's electrical system seem to have the same frequency and pattern in the whole body, but its stronger and higher amplitude in the heart like the whole partitioning in the holographic field reality. Although every portion of what she calls the "Holographic field reality" of the aura contains aspects of the whole energy field, different portions are not absolutely identical to each other. These differing amplitudes keep the energy field from being a static hologram, and instead allow it to be dynamic and flowing.

Another of Hunt's discoveries involves the new science of chaos. The phenomena that can be seen to be a process that is so haphazard they do not appear to be governed by any laws. For example: When smoke rises from an extinguished candle it flows upwards in a thin and narrow stream. Eventually the structure of the stream breaks down and becomes turbulent, its chaotic since its behaviour can no longer be predicted by science. Other examples of chaotic phenomena include water when it crashes at the bottom of a waterfall, also the seemingly random electrical fluctuation that rage through the brain of an epileptic during a seizure, and the weather when several different temperature and air pressure fronts collide. Science has discovered that many chaotic phenomena are not as disordered as they seem and often contain hidden patterns and regularities (recall Bohm's assertion that there is no such thing as disorder, only orders of indefinitely high degrees). Scientists have also discovered mathematical ways of finding some of the regularities that lie hidden in chaotic phenomena.

One of these involves a special kind of mathematical analysis that can convert data about a chaotic phenomena into a shape on a computer screen. If the data contains no hidden patterns, the resulting shape will be a straight line. Otherwise if it contains hidden regularities, the shape will look like some a the spiral design children make by winding coloured yarn around an array of nails into a board. (369 vortices??). These are called "chaos patterns" or "strange attractors" (because the lines that compose the shape seem to be attracted again and again to certain areas of the screen, just as the yarn might be said to be repeatedly "attracted" to the array of nails around which it is wound). (sound also like 369-like vortices patterns).

When Hunt observed energy field data on the oscilloscope, she noticed that if changed constantly. Sometimes it come in great clumps, sometimes it waned and became patchy, as if the energy field itself were in an unceasing state of fluctuation. At first these seemed random but Hunt sensed some order. She ran various tests with data in EKG, EMG, EEG, --> NO CHAOS PATTERNS. BUT when they analyzed the very high frequencies of the field they met success. "we got the most dynamic chaos pattens you ever saw." This meant that although the kaleidoscopic changes taking place in the energy field appeared to be random, they were actually vary highly ordered and rich with patterns. "The pattern is never a repeatable one, nut it's so dynamic and complex, I call it a chaos holograph pattern." Hunt believes her discovery was the first true chaos pattern to be found in a major electrobiological system. Recently researchers have found chaos patterns in EEG recordings of the brain, but they needed MANY MINUTES of data from NUMEROUS ELECTRODES to obtain such a pattern. Hunt obtained aa chaos pattern from three or four seconds of data recorded by ONE ELECTRODE, suggesting that the human energy field id far richer in information and possesses a far more complex and dynamic organization than even the electrical activity of the brain.

## What is the human energy field made of?
Despite the human energy field's electrical aspects, Hint does not believe it is purely electromagnetism in nature. Thinks its more complex and without a doubt composed for an as yet undiscovered energy. Best clue comes from the fact that almost without exception physics describe it as having a higher frequency or vibration then normal matter-energy. Given the uncanny accuracy talented physics have in regards to seeing illnesses in the energy field, we should pay attention to this observation.

It is worth noting that we do not know what any FIELD is. As Bohm said: "What is an electric field? We do not know." When we discover a new kind of field it seems mysterious , then we name it, het used to dealing with it and describing its properties, and it no longer seems mysterious. But we still do not know what an electric or a gravitational field really is. We do not even know what an ELECTRON is, we can only describe its behaviour. This suggests that the human energy field will also ultimately be defined in terms of how it behaves, and research like Hunt's will only further our understanding.

MY THOUGHT AFTER READING THIS^^:
Theory from my intuition:
What if the reason that psychics can see the energy fields/auras is because of their own high frequency? Just like technology allows us to differentiate fluorescent light flickering, since it has the capacity to discern it powering on and of without a brain with low capture-rate who "fills-in" - making it seem continuous flowing of light? And our energy-fields are there without our perception since it's frequency is higher and and flickers faster than our 5 senses can capture --> What it our pineal gland is the 6:th sense receptor for higher frequencies, but is dormant to begin with in normal modern humans?

## Human energy field and the mind
Conscious decision are slower than the unconscious one, and even know it to be true unconsciously and therefore makes it seem consciously for the "mind" ALL before conscious even catches up. The human energy field responds to stimuli even before the brain does. It registers in the field even before it shows up for the brain. Hunt: "I think we have way overrated the brain as the active ingredient in the relationship of a human to the world,"-"It's just a real good computer. But the aspects of the mind that have to do with creativity, imagination, spirituality, and all those things, I do not see them in the brain at all. The MIND's not IN the brain. It's in that darn FIELD."

## Space and Time
Accessing dormant storage of the past and making the shift as a human for extraordinary human abilities have strong correlation to the holographic model. But still latent in all of us. If the hologram is a "white light" - hologram - a piece of film whose image can be seen by the naked eye and does not need a laser light to become visible - when a viewer walks by the film and changes the angle of hit or hers perception, will see what amounts to an 3D motion picture. In other words, as the different images unfold and enfold, they will seem to flow together and present an illusion of movement. The entire activity is always recorded in the hologram but it is the viewer's perspective that changes that provides the illusion that it is unfolding in time. The holographic theory suggests that the same is true of our own past, instead of fading into oblivion, it too remains recorded in the cosmic hologram and can be accessed once again. (This sounds a lot like the akashic records?)

## Hololeaps 
Bohm: "When people dream of accidents correctly and fo not take the plane or ship, it is not the actual future that they were seeing. It was merely something in the present which is implicate and moving toward making that future. In fact the future they saw differed from the actual future because they altered it. Therefore I think it is more plausible to say that, if these phenomena exist, there's an anticipation of the future in the implicate order in the present. As they used to say, coming events cast their shadows in the present. Their shadows are being cast deep in the implicate order."
Bohm's and Loye's descriptions seem to be two different ways of describing the same thing - a view of the future as a hologram that is substantive enough for us to see it, nut malleable enough to be susceptible to change.

## The shadowy stuff of the soul
Studying what people know unconsciously under hypnosis have resulted in many seemingly creditable evidence of reincarnation. Whitton have done impressive studies about their knowledge about the past --> reincarnation?
Open-mindedness is essential considering all the silly-ness surrounding the topic. The main thrust of his work is based on a widely recognized phenomena, even by critics: When people are hypnotized, they often remember what appear to be memories of precious existences. Studies have shown that over 90% of all hypnotizable individuals are able to recall these apparent memories. All reported numerous past lives, some as many as twenty to twenty-five, although a practical limit has reached when Whitton regressed them to what he calls the "Caveman existences", when one lifetime became indistinguishable from the next. All reported that gender was not specific to the soul and that the purpose of life was to evolve and learn, and that multiple existences facilitated this process. But Whitton's most remarkable discovery came when he regressed subjects to the interim between lives, a dazzling, light-filled realm in which there was "no such thing as time or space as we know it." According to his subjects, part of the purpose of this realm was to allow them to PLAN THEIR NEXT LIFE, to literally sketch out the important events and circumstances that would befall them in the future. But this process was not simply some fairy-tale exercise in wish fulfilment. In the realm, they entered an unusual state of consciousness in which they were acutely self-aware and had a hightened moral and ethical sense. In addition, no longer possessed the ability to rationalize away any of their faults and misdeeds, and saw themself with total honesty. He called this state as "[[metaconsciousness]]". Thus when planning their next lives, they did it with a sense of moral obligation choose to be reborn with people whom they had wronged in a precious life for the opportunity to make amends for their actions. They planned pleasant encounters with their "soulmates", individuals with whom they had built a loving and mutually beneficial relationship over many life-times; and scheduled "accidental" events to fulfil still other lessons and purposes. One man said he planned his next life he visualized "a sort of clockwork instrument into which you could insert certain parts in order for specific consequences to follow." - not all pleasant. Some unpleasant consequences is necessary for experience tragedy to force changes like "entire soul complexion" and thus breaking through to a deeper and more positive understanding of the life transgressions, with the purpose of gaining wisdom from it.

Not all subjects were eager to learn about the future their metaconsciousness had laid out for them and instructed that the post-hypnosis to NOT remember the memories. They did not want to be tempted to tamper with the script they had unconsciously written for themself.

"Is it possible that our unconscious mind is not only aware of the rough outline of our destiny, but actually steers us toward fulfilment?"
Whitton: "The message of metaconsciousness is that the life situation of every human being is neither random nor inappropriate. Seen objectively from the interlife, every human experience is simply another lesson in the cosmic classroom."

"If a person dies without completing all the lessons they need to learn, their spirit body returns and is reborn in another physical body."

The Ojibway Indians a persons life is scripted by an invisible spirit or soul and is laid out in a manner that promotes growth and development. The Kahunas call this the aumakua, or "high self."

"A mass of stable light"
"[[Imaginal realm]]"
"Completing their cycle of incarnations here,"
"The without is like the within of things; the small is like the large."
"As above, so below."

"Experience of observing that is important, and not just the act of observation"
## Synchronicities
Describing Jung's definition of synchronicities make me think of the biblical saying "[[road to Damascus]]".
