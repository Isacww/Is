## Key Phrase/Quote
[["Deep down the consciousness mankind is one."]]

No matter how fragmented a person is, [[Ullman]] believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth.

"our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world"

## My Connection
Second part of the book I read: "Holographic  Model of the Universe" written by Talbot.

## Notes:





## What is the human energy field made of?
Despite the human energy field's electrical aspects, Hint does not believe it is purely electromagnetism in nature. Thinks its more complex and without a doubt composed for an as yet undiscovered energy. Best clue comes from the fact that almost without exception physics describe it as having a higher frequency or vibration then normal matter-energy. Given the uncanny accuracy talented physics have in regards to seeing illnesses in the energy field, we should pay attention to this observation.

It is worth noting that we do not know what any FIELD is. As Bohm said: "What is an electric field? We do not know." When we discover a new kind of field it seems mysterious , then we name it, het used to dealing with it and describing its properties, and it no longer seems mysterious. But we still do not know what an electric or a gravitational field really is. We do not even know what an ELECTRON is, we can only describe its behaviour. This suggests that the human energy field will also ultimately be defined in terms of how it behaves, and research like Hunt's will only further our understanding.

MY THOUGHT AFTER READING THIS^^:
Theory from my intuition:
What if the reason that psychics can see the energy fields/auras is because of their own high frequency? Just like technology allows us to differentiate fluorescent light flickering, since it has the capacity to discern it powering on and of without a brain with low capture-rate who "fills-in" - making it seem continuous flowing of light? And our energy-fields are there without our perception since it's frequency is higher and and flickers faster than our 5 senses can capture --> What it our pineal gland is the 6:th sense receptor for higher frequencies, but is dormant to begin with in normal modern humans?

## Human energy field and the mind
Conscious decision are slower than the unconscious one, and even know it to be true unconsciously and therefore makes it seem consciously for the "mind" ALL before conscious even catches up. The human energy field responds to stimuli even before the brain does. It registers in the field even before it shows up for the brain. Hunt: "I think we have way overrated the brain as the active ingredient in the relationship of a human to the world,"-"It's just a real good computer. But the aspects of the mind that have to do with creativity, imagination, spirituality, and all those things, I do not see them in the brain at all. The MIND's not IN the brain. It's in that darn FIELD."

## Space and Time
Accessing dormant storage of the past and making the shift as a human for extraordinary human abilities have strong correlation to the holographic model. But still latent in all of us. If the hologram is a "white light" - hologram - a piece of film whose image can be seen by the naked eye and does not need a laser light to become visible - when a viewer walks by the film and changes the angle of hit or hers perception, will see what amounts to an 3D motion picture. In other words, as the different images unfold and enfold, they will seem to flow together and present an illusion of movement. The entire activity is always recorded in the hologram but it is the viewer's perspective that changes that provides the illusion that it is unfolding in time. The holographic theory suggests that the same is true of our own past, instead of fading into oblivion, it too remains recorded in the cosmic hologram and can be accessed once again. (This sounds a lot like the akashic records?)

## Hololeaps 
Bohm: "When people dream of accidents correctly and fo not take the plane or ship, it is not the actual future that they were seeing. It was merely something in the present which is implicate and moving toward making that future. In fact the future they saw differed from the actual future because they altered it. Therefore I think it is more plausible to say that, if these phenomena exist, there's an anticipation of the future in the implicate order in the present. As they used to say, coming events cast their shadows in the present. Their shadows are being cast deep in the implicate order."
Bohm's and Loye's descriptions seem to be two different ways of describing the same thing - a view of the future as a hologram that is substantive enough for us to see it, nut malleable enough to be susceptible to change.

## The shadowy stuff of the soul
Studying what people know unconsciously under hypnosis have resulted in many seemingly creditable evidence of reincarnation. Whitton have done impressive studies about their knowledge about the past --> reincarnation?
Open-mindedness is essential considering all the silly-ness surrounding the topic. The main thrust of his work is based on a widely recognized phenomena, even by critics: When people are hypnotized, they often remember what appear to be memories of precious existences. Studies have shown that over 90% of all hypnotizable individuals are able to recall these apparent memories. All reported numerous past lives, some as many as twenty to twenty-five, although a practical limit has reached when Whitton regressed them to what he calls the "Caveman existences", when one lifetime became indistinguishable from the next. All reported that gender was not specific to the soul and that the purpose of life was to evolve and learn, and that multiple existences facilitated this process. But Whitton's most remarkable discovery came when he regressed subjects to the interim between lives, a dazzling, light-filled realm in which there was "no such thing as time or space as we know it." According to his subjects, part of the purpose of this realm was to allow them to PLAN THEIR NEXT LIFE, to literally sketch out the important events and circumstances that would befall them in the future. But this process was not simply some fairy-tale exercise in wish fulfilment. In the realm, they entered an unusual state of consciousness in which they were acutely self-aware and had a hightened moral and ethical sense. In addition, no longer possessed the ability to rationalize away any of their faults and misdeeds, and saw themself with total honesty. He called this state as "[[metaconsciousness]]". Thus when planning their next lives, they did it with a sense of moral obligation choose to be reborn with people whom they had wronged in a precious life for the opportunity to make amends for their actions. They planned pleasant encounters with their "soulmates", individuals with whom they had built a loving and mutually beneficial relationship over many life-times; and scheduled "accidental" events to fulfil still other lessons and purposes. One man said he planned his next life he visualized "a sort of clockwork instrument into which you could insert certain parts in order for specific consequences to follow." - not all pleasant. Some unpleasant consequences is necessary for experience tragedy to force changes like "entire soul complexion" and thus breaking through to a deeper and more positive understanding of the life transgressions, with the purpose of gaining wisdom from it.

Not all subjects were eager to learn about the future their metaconsciousness had laid out for them and instructed that the post-hypnosis to NOT remember the memories. They did not want to be tempted to tamper with the script they had unconsciously written for themself.

"Is it possible that our unconscious mind is not only aware of the rough outline of our destiny, but actually steers us toward fulfilment?"
Whitton: "The message of metaconsciousness is that the life situation of every human being is neither random nor inappropriate. Seen objectively from the interlife, every human experience is simply another lesson in the cosmic classroom."

"If a person dies without completing all the lessons they need to learn, their spirit body returns and is reborn in another physical body."

The Ojibway Indians a persons life is scripted by an invisible spirit or soul and is laid out in a manner that promotes growth and development. The Kahunas call this the aumakua, or "high self."
