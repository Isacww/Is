## Notes:

## The holographic model and psychology
[[Jung]] had theories of unconscious visions being connected with hallucinations and schizophrenia to spring from one single source, that we all share, a collective unconsciousness. Later he found described phenomen from seemingly separate sources, patients in psyche-care describing things that can be found in older scripts like a translation two-thousand-year-old persian religious text that described a series of rituals and invocations designed to bring visions. One of the visions, was a tube hanging down from the sun when looking at it, making the wind blow when swinging side-to-side. He called these visions "archetypes", and is so ancient it's as if each of us has the memory of a two-thousand-year-old man lurking somewhere in the depths of our unconscious minds. Bohm: "Deep down the consciousness mankind is one." No matter how fragmented a person is, Ullman believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth. He believes its more than just for the wellbeing of the individual, but that nature is concerned with the species' survival. He also agrees with Bohm on the importance of wholeness and feels that dreams are nature's way of faying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world. "An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. Unless we, the human race, nationally, religiously, economically or whatever, we are going to continue to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the whole picture," - Ullman
