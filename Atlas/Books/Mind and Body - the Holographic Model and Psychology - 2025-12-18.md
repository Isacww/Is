## My Connection
Second part of the book I read: "Holographic  Model of the Universe" written by Talbot.

## Notes:

## The holographic model and psychology
[[Jung]] had theories of unconscious visions being connected with hallucinations and schizophrenia to spring from one single source, that we all share, a collective unconsciousness. Later he found described phenomen from seemingly separate sources, patients in psyche-care describing things that can be found in older scripts like a translation two-thousand-year-old persian religious text that described a series of rituals and invocations designed to bring visions. One of the visions, was a tube hanging down from the sun when looking at it, making the wind blow when swinging side-to-side. He called these visions "archetypes", and is so ancient it's as if each of us has the memory of a two-thousand-year-old man lurking somewhere in the depths of our unconscious minds. Bohm: "Deep down the consciousness mankind is one." No matter how fragmented a person is, Ullman believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth. He believes its more than just for the wellbeing of the individual, but that nature is concerned with the species' survival. He also agrees with Bohm on the importance of wholeness and feels that dreams are nature's way of faying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world. "An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. Unless we, the human race, nationally, religiously, economically or whatever, we are going to continue to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the whole picture," - Ullman
Schizophrenic persons could have glimpses int o this implicate wholeness and try to convey this, but for them it is as if they share thoughts with others and see things like: "Event A follows event B" as the same as "Event B follows event A". All time sequences is not meaningful since all points in time are equal. Same foes for spacial relations.

## Lucid dreaming and parallel universes
Physicist Fred Alan Wolf asserted that holographic may help explain the unusual phenomenon of lucid dreaming. Where the subject is awake and aware in the dream leading to ability of control and impact in the dream. He points our that a piece of holographic film actually generates two images, a virtual image that appears to be in the space behind the film, and a real image that comes into focus in the space in front of the film. Difference is the light waver that compose a virtual image seem to be delivering **FROM** an apparent focus or source. As we have seen, this is an illusion, for the virtual image of a hologram has no more extension in space than does the image in a mirror. But the real image is formed by light waves that are coming **TO** a focus, and this is NOT an illusion and DOES posses extension in space. Little attention is paid to this rea, image that comes into focus in empty air because its invisible and can only be seen when dust particles pass through it, or when someone blows a puff of smoke through it. Wolf believes that all dreams are internal holograms, and ordinary dreams are less vivid because they are virtual images. However, he thinks the brain also has the ability to generate real images, and that is exactly ehat it does when we are dreaming lucidly. The unusual vibrancy of the lucid dream is due to the fact that the waces are converging NOT diverging. "If there is a 'viewer' where these waves focus, that viewer will be bathed in the scene, and the scene coming to fucus will 'contain' him" --> Experienced 'lucid'.

## The infinite subway
Grof studied patients with repeated LSD treatment which "let them tap into all sorts of lifeforms, embody them and then being able to talk about it as if they had lived as them," everything from past humans to plants, animals and planets, inside their mothers womb and inanimate objects. All backed up if possible. Volunteers of all sorts from all different professions and life-styles. "LSD provided the human consciousness with access to a kind of infinite s"
