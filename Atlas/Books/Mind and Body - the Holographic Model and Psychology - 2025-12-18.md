## My Connection
Second part of the book I read: "Holographic  Model of the Universe" written by Talbot.

## Notes:

## The holographic model and psychology
[[Jung]] had theories of unconscious visions being connected with hallucinations and schizophrenia to spring from one single source, that we all share, a collective unconsciousness. Later he found described phenomen from seemingly separate sources, patients in psyche-care describing things that can be found in older scripts like a translation two-thousand-year-old persian religious text that described a series of rituals and invocations designed to bring visions. One of the visions, was a tube hanging down from the sun when looking at it, making the wind blow when swinging side-to-side. He called these visions "archetypes", and is so ancient it's as if each of us has the memory of a two-thousand-year-old man lurking somewhere in the depths of our unconscious minds. Bohm: "Deep down the consciousness mankind is one." No matter how fragmented a person is, Ullman believes that dreams will strive to show the truth of a person and repeatedly try to surface it in an apparent attempt to offer new opportunities to come to terms with the truth. He believes its more than just for the wellbeing of the individual, but that nature is concerned with the species' survival. He also agrees with Bohm on the importance of wholeness and feels that dreams are nature's way of faying to counteract our seemingly unending compulsion to fragment the world. "An individual can disconnect from all that's cooperative, meaningful, and loving and still survive, but nations don't have that luxury. Unless we, the human race, nationally, religiously, economically or whatever, we are going to continue to find ourselves in a position where we can accidentally destroy the whole picture," - Ullman
Schizophrenic persons could have glimpses int o this implicate wholeness and try to convey this, but for them it is as if they share thoughts with others and see things like: "Event A follows event B" as the same as "Event B follows event A". All time sequences is not meaningful since all points in time are equal. Same foes for spacial relations.

## Lucid dreaming and parallel universes
Physicist Fred Alan Wolf asserted that holographic may help explain the unusual phenomenon of lucid dreaming. Where the subject is awake and aware in the dream leading to ability of control and impact in the dream. He points our that a piece of holographic film actually generates two images, a virtual image that appears to be in the space behind the film, and a real image that comes into focus in the space in front of the film. Difference is the light waver that compose a virtual image seem to be delivering **FROM** an apparent focus or source. As we have seen, this is an illusion, for the virtual image of a hologram has no more extension in space than does the image in a mirror. But the real image is formed by light waves that are coming **TO** a focus, and this is NOT an illusion and DOES posses extension in space. Little attention is paid to this rea, image that comes into focus in empty air because its invisible and can only be seen when dust particles pass through it, or when someone blows a puff of smoke through it. Wolf believes that all dreams are internal holograms, and ordinary dreams are less vivid because they are virtual images. However, he thinks the brain also has the ability to generate real images, and that is exactly ehat it does when we are dreaming lucidly. The unusual vibrancy of the lucid dream is due to the fact that the waces are converging NOT diverging. "If there is a 'viewer' where these waves focus, that viewer will be bathed in the scene, and the scene coming to fucus will 'contain' him" --> Experienced 'lucid'.

## The infinite subway
Grof studied patients with repeated LSD treatment which "let them tap into all sorts of lifeforms, embody them and then being able to talk about it as if they had lived as them," everything from past humans to plants, animals and planets, inside their mothers womb and inanimate objects. All backed up if possible. Volunteers of all sorts from all different professions and life-styles. "LSD provided the human consciousness with access to a kind of infinite subway system, a laburinth of tunnels and byways that existed in the sub-terranean reaches of the unconscious, and one that litterley connected everything in the universe with everything else." Grof Said thathe had no doubt after 3000-five-hour sessions of data and 2000 more from colleues, that there is an urgent need for drastic revision of existing paradigms for psychology, psychiatry, medicine, and possible science in general, no doubt in his mind that our current understanding of the universe, of the nature of "reality and particularly of human being, is superficial, incorrect and incomplete." He call it [[transpersonal]] to describe this phenomena, experiences in which the consciousness transcends the customary bounderies of the personality. Now this area of research is called: [[transpersonal psychology]]. Even he see the [[holographic]] theory to explain what he saw. Grof developed a nondrug [[holotropic therapy]] to achieve the experiences through body work such as: rapid controlled breathing, evocative music, and massage to enduce altered states of consciousness with much success. His work is detailed in the book: "[[The adventure of self-discovery]]"

## A flaw in the fabric of reality
Another of Jung's great contributions was defining the concept of synchronicity. They reveal the absence of division between the physical world and our inner psychological reality. Thus the relative scarcity of synchronous experiences in our liver show not only the extent to which we have fragmented ourselves from the general field of consciousness but also the degree to which we have sealed ourselves off from the infinite and dazzling potential of the deeper orders of mind and reality.
"Synchronicity is coincidences that are so unusual and so meaningful they hardly could be attributed to chance alone."
Like Jung's scarab story, pointing to a rebirth of his patient during painstaking sessions. He said that they almost always accompanied periods of emotional intensity and transformation: fundamental changes in beliefs, sudden and new insights, deaths, births and even changes in profession. "is the human mind operating, for a moment, in its true order and extending throughout society and nature moving through orders of increasing subtletly, reaching past the source of mind and matter into creativity itself."

## I sing the body holographic
The brain can not always determine what's "out there" and what it thinks is "out there." Which is why the phantom limb phenomenon occurs to amputees. Put in another way, in a brain that operates holographically, the remembered image of a thing can have as much impact on the senses as the thing itself, which is used in a selective treatments for hard cases of cancer patients. Imaginative exercises can turn hopelessness to miracles. Everyone can feel this when imagining somebody we love and feel a rush in the heart, same goes for anyone who has ever felt their palms grow sweaty after conjuring up the memory of some unusually frightening experience. This is strange, but holographically we asserts ALL experiences, wether real or imagined are reduced to the same common language of organized wave forms - the situations become less puzzling. Achterberg says: "when images are regarded in the holographic manner, their omnipotent influence on physical function logically follows, The image, the behavior, and the physiological concomitants are a unified aspect of the same phenomenon." Later performed experiments where different subject groups where student learned to increase the number of only one particular type of white cell population, T-cells and more. When learnt the [[imagery]] --> it had a significant increase in the targeted cell types.
**Breznits found that the stress hormone levels in the soldiers' blood always reflected their estimates and not the actual distance they had marched. Their bodies responded not to reality, but to what they were imagining as reality.** Which also had explains why the placeebo effect con have such positive impact. 

## Psychokinesis
Dunne propose that psychokinesis (PK) actually involves an exchange of information
## Synchronicities
Describing Jung's definition of synchronicities make me think of the biblical saying "[[road to Damascus]]".
